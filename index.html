                  <blockquote class="md:w-4/5 text-md px-4"><p>K.D. was hired as the primary developer on a Laravel / Vue.js project for Idestini that lasted 6 months. We had a long list of high level functional requirements on this project but often did not have time to mockup screens and get approval before needing to get to building sections of the application. K.D. was able to assess best practices and examples from other platforms and apply them into our own unique solutions.</p>
<p>I can vouch that K.D. is 100% capable of performing on any project that uses Laravel, MySQL, Vue.js, Gulp, Node, SASS, Bootstrap, chimp.js or any similar platforms. K.D. is very knowledgeable about programming frameworks and patterns and makes solid architectural decisions.</p>
<p>K.D. is a smart, pragmatic developer. He’s honest and gives 100% to the project. I hope to be able to work with him again.</p>

                  <blockquote class="md:w-4/5 text-md px-4"><p>I have had the pleasure to work with K.D. since July 2014 when we hired him as a senior backend developer for my firm LogicBomb Media. When we interviewed K.D. we knew that we had met a developer that had an intimate relationship with PHP and JavaScript. Once he had joined our team it was almost immediately obvious that his technique was, frankly, superior to our own.</p>
<p>Our industry can tend to be populated by cynics, know-it-alls and yes men. K.D. defies all of these traits. When we began to approach him for advice on projects he conveyed that knowledge with enthusiasm, was always respectful to junior team members, instructed in a confident way, and always shared his knowledge with patience. It was clear that his intentions were to help the team be the best it could be, to build the best projects we could, and to create fantastic experiences for our client’s customers.</p>
<p>In my 9 years of running this business we have worked with dozens of design firms, advertising agencies, and other development firms to collaborate on applications and marketing sites. In those 9 years I’ve never met someone that can envision the whole product as well as K.D. can. His foresight, careful planning, and ability to see problems and use cases gave me new perspective on how we could tackle problems for our clients.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about K.D.’s skill set or my experience working with K.D. please feel free to reach out at any time.</p>

This is a great combination and something that will make Mr. Dockins a welcomed and valued member of any team.</p>
