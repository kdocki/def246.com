After a little investigating I found an open source Student View building block developed by cool Aussie cat named Wiley Fuller. The block exposes a course tool for the teacher to click which causes a demo student to be created and enrolled into the course and then switches the instructor to the freshly made demo student.

                        <p>In the old days of WebCT, instructors were given a <a href="/media/student-view-building-block/studentview.png" data-lightbox="studentview">tab</a> that allowed them to view their course as a student. In Blackboard 9.1 this functionality is missing and much missed!</p>
<p>After a little investigating I found an <strong>open source</strong> <a href="http://projects.oscelot.org/gf/project/studentview/">Student View building block</a> developed by cool Aussie cat named <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/wiley-fuller/0/895/905">Wiley Fuller</a>. The block exposes a course tool for the teacher to click which causes a demo student to be created and enrolled into the course and then switches the instructor to the freshly made demo student.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>However, I found a few things missing so I decided to chip into the open source community. Here they are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Demo students can be grouped into a data source key</li>
<li>Demo student accounts can be prefixed with a custom tag set by system admin</li>
<li>Demo student that is created can be named after the course pkid (default), teacher’s pkid or the teacher’s username.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can view my code changes with subversion. I left it up to Wiley to merge the <a href="http://projects.oscelot.org/gf/project/studentview/scmsvn/?action=browse&amp;path=%2Fbranches%2F">branch</a> back into the trunk (which eventually he did). Wiley also implemented velocity templates for the RenderingHook which allows the B2 to interject javascript code and add those nifty little Student/Teacher view links to the course menu.</p>
