I was presented a catalyst award this year from Blackboard for Innovative Development.

There are certainly <a data-lightbox="blackboard-catalyst-award" href="/media/blackboard-catalyst-award-innovative-development/catalyst-awards-1.png">plenty of other developers</a> out there who are more innovative than me, but nonetheless I walked up to the stage (twice) and accepted the handshake and all that good stuff.
<p>I almost missed the first acceptance because I was busy talking to so many people was in front of the DevCon audience with <a href="http://gkroner.com/">George Kroner</a> and <a href="http://www.johnfontaine.com/">John Fontaine</a>. Look how <a data-lightbox="blackboard-catalyst-award" href="/media/blackboard-catalyst-award-innovative-development/catalyst-awards-2.png">sexy I am.</a> ^_^</p>
<p>The second acceptance I received was at the Catalyst Awards lunch where I got to shake hands with the CTO of Blackboard - Ray Henderson. Ray pretty much manages the entire academic technology side of Blackboard, while the CEO, Michael Chasen, is the figurehead and strategy giver.</p>

And speaking of figureheads, I got this big huge shiny award to take home and put on a shelf. I haven't quite found a place for it yet, and I think I'll have to clean out my office first before I get it out of the box. I wonder how much these glass awards cost - think I could eBay it or something? Maybe I'll check that out later... but enough about my award, let's discuss Blackboard World!
<p><strong>It was exhausting.</strong></p>
<p><a href="/media/blackboard-catalyst-award-innovative-development/bb-recap.mp4">My wife, daughter and I</a> actually made it in the background of the <a href="(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2P7lxjkr4fU)">BbWorld recap video</a> - talking with other award winners. Blackboard World was extremely busy this year. I started with <a href="http://www.oscelot.org/OSCELOT/dashboard/open-source-days">Open Source Day</a> (<a href="/media/blackboard-catalyst-award-innovative-development/open-source-days-oscelot.pdf">pdf</a>) Sunday morning, DevCon Monday through Tuesday, and finished up BbWorld Thursday night. I meet a lot of interesting people, saw a lot of new stuff and worked my butt off every day.</p>

<p>Here’s my re-cap on my experience in New Orleans:</p>
<ul>
<li>They say <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/blackboardtv/7548688822/in/set-72157629769552788/">birds of a feather, flock together</a> - which is probably why I like open source day so much.</li>
<li>I presented at DevCon. (next post)</li>
<li>My favorite DevCon session was by <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/BlackboardInc/devcon-2012-william-boyd-title-of-presentation">William Boyd</a> about Spring @Security and Blackboard entitlements.</li>
<li>Best speech was by <a href="http://twitter.com/khanacademy">Sal Khan</a> who shared how <a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> all started and the direction its headed.</li>
<li>Didn’t really have a favorite BbWorld session (those were kind of boring).</li>
<li>Ate tons of Cajun food, including duck gumbo, fat shrimp and ratatouille</li>
<li><strong>My favorite part</strong>: Got to feel my little girl playing the drums in her momma’s belly (as we walked by Bourbon street performers playing drums).</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of the week we were exhausted of New Orleans and ready to go home and rest.</p>
