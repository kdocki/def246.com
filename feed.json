Please allow me to explain.</p>\n<h3>1) Self Hosted</h3>\n<p>At many times I would start a new blog or website to experiment with the content management system (CMS) and setup a server and other applications (apache, php, etc). It was all just a big cluster of <u>experimenting</u>, which is how I learn - by doing. In this sense, websites were a good way to learn technology and how to administrate that technology. A consequence of experimenting though is that things break - <strong>a lot</strong> - and thus websites became a chore.</p>\n<h3>2) Self Maintained</h3>\n<p>Did I mention that this self-hosted server was a box sitting in my closet. So what if the electricity goes off or that server hard drive crashes (or a dog pees on it)? I managed to use <a href=\"http://www.vmware.com/\">VMWare</a> to help consolidate electricity costs but that box still used some electricity 24/7.</p>\n<p>Cost was not the only concerns I had. Security. In order to host a website I needed to punch a hole in my firewall thus allowing security breaches into my home. What advantages do I gain by giving hackers/<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_kiddie\">skiddies</a> a DNS location and open ports to my home? Nothing much, the more I think about it.</p>\n<h3>3) Selfish</h3>\n<p>This hasn’t changed much. I’m still a selfish person and thus I crave free website hosting. I desire an easy way to update the website. Put simply: <strong>I can still be lazy and have a website</strong>. This is how I came about Weebly, and man, do I love it! Weebly allows me as a web developer to slap up a website in minutes and for <strong>free!</strong> It goes above and beyond any CMS I have ever used (and I have used too many to count) with the drag and drop “widget style” interface. Don’t get me wrong, there are still many improvements to be made on Weebly, but on many levels, <strong>Weebly is doing it right!</strong></p>\n",

Read more for some context…</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<p><strong>First, some context.</strong> UALR does not have a campus-wide video solution managed by IT (like Kaltura or a campus-wide Youtube). When I first arrived to my new job at the university, instantly there were several major issues that struck out at me about the existing process for creating online videos. The turn around for a single video was about 3 days. This meant that 10 videos had about a month turn around. This delay was caused by the lack of automation. Therefore my primary focus (as you will see in the videos) was around automation. There was a single person working full time on video management and she had been given a set of very manual instructions written by another person who handled the videos before leaving. Cutting down on the amount of labor for this lady, meant she could spend less time handling videos and more time being productive elsewhere. Some obvious to-dos were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Automate video re-encoding (utilize existing campus resources)</li>\n<li>Delegate access to teachers (encourage self-service model)</li>\n<li>Re-use flash video player (use parameters, instead of building new swf for each video)</li>\n</ul>\n<img class=\"w-full\" src=\"/projects/images/image_01.jpg\">\n<p>Below is a video, so you can get an idea of the processes and environment before I arrived and insight into the solution provided and also why I did some of the things that I did.</p>\n<p>{% youtube rYdKbDXt7Vc %}</p>\n<p>This process has saved our office countless hours. While it is not perfect, it works - and is an improvement. It saves other offices time as well. For example, Disability Resources Center captions existing videos and to have one central location for search for videos saves them a lot of time. The instructors enjoy the new process as well because it allows them to be flexible with shorter turn around - usually within the hour the video is ready for playback on Blackboard.</p>\n",

It allows you to organize your photos and even has facial detection software so you can detect people in your album. It’s sort of like tagging your friends in Facebook except that Picasa does it for you automatically. I can imagine this same algorithm would make Google+ very popular in the realm of photography (at least where people you know are actually in the photos).</p>\n<h3>Android Integration</h3>\n<p>Why tell Facebook where you are, your phone knows that already. There are so many benefits here I can’t list them. Given that Google rules the Android world, and many of the applications that make smart phones great… they can’t go wrong.</p>\n<h3>Websites, games and more</h3>\n<p>After I signed up for Google+, I noticed a whole new experience with in my Chrome browser (also another Google product). It seems that Google+ has this +1 button everywhere, and it will let me know about all the cool stuff Google+ can offer. It’s everywhere. In reality, it is going to be impossible to ignore Google+.</p>\n<img class=\"w-full\" src=\"/media/google-vs-facebook/monopoly.png\">\n<p>Obviously, I sound like a big Google Fanboy so I’m going to talk about something else besides how wonderful Google is. I’m not a stock guy and over $500 per share seems very, very steep. I have no clue what will happen to Google’s stock but I can guess that apart from a government take over (to prevent googolopoloy), there is great promise in Google Corp.</p>\n<p>I know their apps are amazing, and developers (including myself) love to work with the api. It is simple. It is built by creative minds and crafted with simplicity in mind - not to mention the documentation. Google Apps provides clean documentation, tutorials to get started and plenty of client library support.</p>\n<p>My biggest beef with Google Apps is that if there is a bug with the products, it’s difficult to get in touch with a “real person.” Also, why have they not opened the developer api for Google+ yet? I may have to put some of my Google experience to use and develop a Google+ application - which will hopefully rival <a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api\">Facebook’s Graph API</a> which happens to be pretty sleek.</p>\n<p>Which brings me to my next beef. The APIs change quite frequently and depreciate rapidly (for example, see the Google Spreadsheet API). And Facebook is notorious for changing it’s API constantly. What’s FBML again? Now, granted I am a web developer and not a business hat, I have really been looking at this from the developer perspective and, I can tell you from this view… Google+ has no where to go but up. It’s still not ready to compete with Facebook, but it’s getting closer every day.</p>\n",

At last, persisting data for your Java web application is not all xml, POJOS, EJBs and did I mention xml? I don’t hate xml but I find configuring your application extremely inefficient after working with other frameworks that utilize convention over configuration.</p>\n<p>Why do I have to specifiy a log4j properties file, hibernate persistance.xml configuration. And there’s soooo many options of how to develop: JPA, Wicket, OJB, Spring, Struts, Torque, Cayenne, Jaxor, TJDO, JDBM, pBeans, JPOX, Simple ORM, Ibatis, XORM, Speedo, Smyle, PAT, LiDO, JDO, IntelliBO, KodoJDO, Hamlets, Faces, RIFE, Shale, Sling, Stripes, Vaadin, Poopdeck (okay, I just made that one up). Point is that It can be a real headache to develop a Java web app.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, why do I have to create my POJOs and SQL for my database? Why can’t a framework just create my data objects, along with nice RESTful CRUD operations for each. <em>Why, crow, why?!</em> So at least for the moment, finding ActiveObjects is lemonade to quench my thirst for answers.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<p>The documentation is lacking for ActiveObject but I was able to get it working quite easily. As soon as I saw the interface annotations for this library, I knew it would be a blast working with - assuming the pesticides had been spread around the source code e.g. no bugs. The website can be found here: <a href=\"http://java.net/projects/activeobjects/pages/Home\">http://java.net/projects/activeobjects/pages/Home</a></p>\n<p>Below I have an example on how to use Active Objects. Let us assume our web application has the concept of “templates” which we want to persist in the database. Templates can have questions, instances and permissions (those are all just interfaces too). As you can see below we just define java interfaces with get and set methods. You don’t implement the methods, just define them for reflection by AO. Also every interface will have a <code>getID()</code> method inherited from the parent Entity class. You can also add any annotations to describe any more specific mappings between your Java interface, other interfaces and also types for the database table.

Therefore I never actually got around to using this code, but I’ll share it with you since you’re already here. And I wanna give a big shout out to Peter Fokkinga’s since I’m using his DbUtils class which can be found on <a href=\"http://forums.edugarage.com/cfs-filesystemfile.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Components.UserFiles/00.00.00.22.76/DbUtils.java.txt\">edugarage</a>.</p>\n<pre><code>// a class that I would use to get the Active Objects Database connection\n// however didn't use due to the inconsistent behavior of data returned from\n// Blackboard's VirtualInstallation (found case in 9.1.7 where bad database host was given\n\npublic class Database extends net.java.ao.DatabaseProvider {\n        static Database _instance;\n        static EntityManager _manager;\n\n        @Override\n        public Class&lt;? extends Driver&gt; getDriverClass() throws ClassNotFoundException {\n                VirtualInstallation vi = Database.information();\n\n                if(vi.getDbType().equals(&quot;mssql&quot;)) return (Class&lt;? extends Driver&gt;) Class.forName(&quot;com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver&quot;);\n\n                else if(vi.getDbType().equals(&quot;oracle&quot;)) return (Class&lt;? extends Driver&gt;) Class.forName(&quot;oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver&quot;);\n\n                return null;\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        protected String renderAutoIncrement() {\n                VirtualInstallation vi = Database.information();\n                if(vi.getDbType().equals(&quot;mssql&quot;)) return &quot;IDENTITY(1,1)&quot;;\n\n                return &quot;IDENTITY&quot;;\n        }\n\n\n        public static Database instance()\n        {\n                if(_instance == null) {\n                        VirtualInstallation vi = Database.information();\n\n                        String dbInstance = (vi.getDbInstance() != null ? vi.getDbInstance() : &quot;&quot;) + &quot;/&quot; + vi.getDbUser();\n\n                        DbUtils.SupportedDatabase dbType = DbUtils.SupportedDatabase.fromDriver(vi.getDbType());\n\n                        String jdbc = dbType.getConnectString(vi.getDbHost(), vi.getDbPort(), dbInstance);\n\n                        _instance = new Database(jdbc, vi.getDbUser(), vi.getDbPass());\n                }\n\n                return _instance;\n        }\n\n        public static EntityManager manager() throws PlugInException\n        {\n                if(_manager == null) {\n                        _manager = new EntityManager(instance());\n                }\n\n                return _manager;\n        }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>So how would we use this Database class? Assuming the virtual installation worked consistently, below is an example using Spring with controller request mappings of how to do an edit and update.</p>\n<p>Assuming you had the Database class from above then you could do something like this in your controller, below I really only use the find() but you can use all the goodies from Active Objects (see here: <a href=\"http://activeobjects.java.net/0.8.2/api\">http://activeobjects.java.net/0.8.2/api</a>) like create, count, find, get, delete, and even migrate (creates your table for you just based on the interface definitions). Yes, you don’t use a POJO class, you use an POJO interface - which is really just genius.</p>\n<pre><code>@RequestMapping(value=&quot;/templates/{id}&quot;, method = RequestMethod.GET)\npublic String get(@PathVariable(&quot;id&quot;) Integer id, Model model) {\n\n        Template[] templates = Database.manager().find(Template.class, &quot;id = ?&quot;, id);\n\n        // We didn't find a template with this id so just show the index page\n        if(templates.length == 0) return &quot;redirect:/templates/&quot;;\n\n        // found a template with this id, so let's edit that template\n        model.addAttribute(&quot;template&quot;, templates[0]);\n        model.addAttribute(&quot;helper&quot;, new ViewHelper());\n\n        return &quot;templates/edit&quot;;\n}\n\n@RequestMapping(value=&quot;/templates/{id}&quot;, method = RequestMethod.POST)\npublic String update(HttpServletRequest request, @PathVariable(&quot;id&quot;) Integer id,\n                                                 Model model) {\n\n        // Get the requests for this template\n        String name = request.getParameter(&quot;template_name&quot;);\n        String description = request.getParameter(&quot;template_description_text&quot;);\n        String includePattern = request.getParameter(&quot;include_pattern_text&quot;);\n        String excludePattern = request.getParameter(&quot;exclude_pattern_text&quot;);\n\n        // Find the template and save the new values\n        Template[] templates = Database.manager().find(Template.class, &quot;id = ?&quot;, id);\n        if(templates.length != 0) {\n\n                templates[0].setName(name);\n                templates[0].setDescription(description);\n                templates[0].setIncludePattern(includePattern);\n                templates[0].setExcludePattern(excludePattern);\n\n                templates[0].save();\n        }\n\n        return &quot;redirect:/templates/&quot;;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>f I come onto any projects that need a standalone website I would like to combine the Grails or Play! framework and use ActiveObjects for the Model part of the MVC framework - resulting in sheer Java bad-ass-ery. I know Java is a huge language and web frameworks only covers a small part of it’s ability; however, I really like the idea of Java becoming a competitor for simple turnkey web apps, the same ones that can be made in a short time using the conventions of CakePHP, Zend, Django and Rails. Developing in Play! and ActiveObjects is just plain easier. I don’t imagine that JEE, ContextFactories and extensive xml configurations are just going to magically disappear (you know job security and all that), but this is the age of designing RESTful web services and shunning away the complexities of CORBA and even SOAP.</p>\n<p>I’m sure in ten years, something new will be along to lay rest to REST (sorry I couldn’t resist) but for now, the general consensus seems to be that web applications should be very simple to develop and maintain, i.e. wham, bam, thank you mam.</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p>We have come so far in technology yet still use the same relational SQL database methodologies as we did in the 90’s. We <em>waste</em> countless hours and money on SQL discussing details which have nothing to do with the actual data we place inside this storage space. When we are finished with the database, we still have plenty of work left, building applications to access and mutate that same data set.</p>\n<!-- more --> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.bryny.com/stu_sql.htm\"><img src=\"/media/restful-data-sources/sqltricks.gif\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Thus, only a programmer can access the data. Those same programmers whom likely don’t fully understand the information collected and stored within the database. Programmers care about stuff like, <strong>structure</strong>, <strong>performance</strong>, <strong>security</strong>, <strong>servers</strong> and whatnot but data is just data. Later programmers will use an ORM to piece back together the data which was broken apart into a relational database only to re-structure the data into an object format. I could go on and on here, but my point is: <em>SQL can be really stupid.</em> Objects are easy. Resources are easy too. This got me to thinking…</p>\n<p>Not too long ago I was skimming a research paper about <a href=\"http://dret.net/netdret/docs/wilde-www2010-restful-sql.pdf\">HTTP Database Connector (HDBC)</a> because about two years ago I came up with an idea. The idea was simple. <strong>Data is accessed via the web</strong>, thus why not just access your data via a RESTful web data source instead through a custom built application fetching off of back end SQL database(s)? At the time I thought the idea to be revolutionary, but I’m certainly not the first to come up with this idea though: <a href=\"http://www.jasondb.com/jasondb/jasondb.html\">JasonDB</a>, <a href=\"http://www.devreference.org/bookmarks/couchdb-restful-database-json-documents-php-how-to.html\">CouchDB</a>, <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/restdb/\">Google RestDB</a>.</p>\n<p>I think most anyone can understand objects, especially subject matter experts (SME) on particular objects, e.g. a chemist understand the toxicology of lead and mercury but knows nothing about SQL. Let’s use an example to illustrate. Both ways we just want to get the price of a wheel for a specific car.</p>\n<div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-sm-6\">\n**The SQL Way**\n<pre><code>Db = new Database(&quot;jdbc://hostname:port:user:pass&quot;);\nSql = &quot;select price from wheel where car_id = ?&quot;;\nRows = Db.getSelectQuery(Sql, &quot;00026213938&quot;);\nprice = null;\nfor each Row in Rows; do\n   price = row[0];\n</code></pre>\n</div><div class=\"col-sm-6\">\n**Object Way**\n<pre><code>Db = new Database(&quot;http://some.place/data&quot;);\nDb.Authenticate(&quot;user&quot;, &quot;pass&quot;);\nprice = Db.car(&quot;00026213938&quot;).wheel.price\n</code></pre>\n</div></div>\n<p>Accessing and manipulating data shouldn’t be difficult. I think using REST as a gateway framework to our data sets, we keep things simple for the poor programmer (sucker) who has to design a web application around the data for the people that actually make use of the data.</p>\n<p>I wrote this paper about rest a few years ago and it reflects a brainstorming/soapbox approach to how ReST might be used to help the overall challenges we face in web development. Since that time Facebook has implemented the GraphAPI and other providers have started using ReST-ful apis to expose data.</p>\n<h3>This is what happens when I get bored (A paper I wrote two years ago)</h3>\n<p>This morning I woke up. A thought occured to me. I am so very small in a big world, a world that is always busy. Why do I even bother with knowledge? The more I seem to know the more I realize I don’t know. And the internet, an even busier world than our own is always evolving. Facebook, twitter, google docs, google maps, google this, google that, dropbox, piscasa, and the list goes on and on for what seems like infinity.</p>\n<p>As a computer scientist I have a somewhat jaded view of the Internet and the technology surrounding it. One particular example is of an architecture that is built to run parrellel with the Internet: REpresentational State Transfer (REST). After reading Roy Fielding’s paper that first proposed this archaric idea many years ago - I felt that my eyes had been opened to a dark secert place in the Internet, a place that I had known about many years but had never really ventured there.</p>\n<p>However, I’m a web/system developer and I have worked as an systems administrator as well. And to be frank, while web services are a wonderful idea, there are some problems that developers and administrators run into when implementing and maintaining them. I started to observe how I could simplify everyone else’s work just by doing a little smart programming.</p>\n<p>But first I want to cover REST and some “terminology” so that we can all agree on the semantics.</p>\n<p>REST has nouns, adjectives and verbs.</p>\n<p>Nouns\nA noun is a resource, for example: cats, dogs, students, movies, people, circles, nouns, places, etcs. What did you notice about all those listed nouns? They are all plural. While it is not nesscary, it is good design to make your resources (URI) plural when using REST. You can have an unlimited number of nouns.</p>\n<p>Adjectives\nA noun can exist, but without descriptions it is a pretty boring noun. Adjectives can be seen as properties of a noun. If our noun was cat then a few adjectives might be: fur type, eye color, size, gender. These adjectives are part of what makes a cat a cat. You wouldn’t expect to have motor as an adjective of a cat, cat’s don’t have motors.</p>\n<p>Verbs\nUnlike nouns, verbs are limited. But this is the beauty of REST. We can simplify actions. You can only have a select few. Here they are: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, HEAD. These verbs are to allow you to implement ‘CRUD’ operations on your existing nouns. For example,</p>\n<pre><code>GET http://foobar.com/cup/1\nPOST http://foobar.com/cup/1\nPUT http://foobar.com/cup/1\nDELETE http://foobar.com/cup/1\n</code></pre>\n<p>… and I will cover PATCH, HEAD and OPTIONS in a minute. But first, let’s cover our CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations. It is important that we are on the same page here.</p>\n<pre><code>GET does a 'read' operation\nPOST 'creates' a new resource\nPUT 'updates' an existing resource (the entire thing, no partial updates allowed!)\nDELETE 'delete's an existing resource\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let’s talk about PUT. When we put a resource back (update it) we must be sure to list all the adjectives describing that noun. If we do not we run the risk of dropping those adjectives. This is why a PATCH method was proposed and approved. Many people want to update a noun partially. They want you to know everything about their noun, but change one little adjective. For example, let’s say the cat’s name has changed from peppe le pue to scrodinger but nothing else has changed about the cat. I want to PATCH that cat’s name, else I have to GET the cat and then PUT him back. There are many questions that come up about this, including locking the cat up so no one else can touch him, if someone changes a cat the same time I do, what happens to the cat? Let’s ignore those questions, they aren’t important for this paper.</p>\n<p>Usage Scenario</p>\n<pre><code>We have three users. The back-end developer, the administrator and the end-user developer. The back-end developer creates the back-end resources and the URI to those resources. The administrator controls who has access to those resources. And finally the end-user developer engages documentation and finally the resources and uses the data from those resources to implement another product.\n\nIs this the way it goes? Is this as good as it gets? And this doesn't include the technical writer who writes documentation for the end-user developer, explaining how to use the resources available. But I want to keep it DaD (developer administrator developer) and leave out QA testers and managers and other people who make our lives worth living. Let's assume that every user is tech-savvy. Ha. Okay, or not.\n</code></pre>\n<p>This problem is taking up my time\nI hear people say that REST takes an indefinate about of time to start up. The road to RESTiality is a long one. Why? If it takes the back-end developer 5 weeks before he can finish something to show the administrator and the administrator has to configure/setup the system for 4 weeks and the end-user developer takes 3 weeks to successfully use the system; then it has taken 3 months before any real end-user progress has occurred. That is all based on these useless and factious numbers I just made up. How can we speed this process up?</p>\n<p>Here is a list of mangled thoughts about the above usage scenario (it is rather generic on purpose)\n- Assessability (ease of use)\n- Knowledge Transfer\n- Documentation\n- Lack of standards for web browsers (and development tools)\n- Service Orientied Minds</p>\n<p>Accessability (Ease of use)\nThe RESTful mind tries to tackle this issue by using ‘standards’ like http basic authentication and URIs that can be requested and responded to via HTTP. Issues of security still exist though: user management for example. How do you manage users? And who has access to what? What if someone looses an eye or a password? So many service providers have switched to oauth to help with their woes of security. Some have setup complicated role based systems to solve their problems. The question is how should it be done?</p>\n<p>Knowledge Transfer\nEveryone has to know something about the system in order for it to work successfully. How do manage the knowledge from the back-end developer to the end-user developer? And also the administrator?</p>\n<p>Lack of standards\nOne example is that\tmany browsers are not directly compatiable with PUT. This makes PUT more difficult to work with than GET and POST and thus, some developers just outright ignore PUT. In fact, this is where some of the complexity comes from. Take for example, POST /cat/update.php?id=1&amp;name=scrodinger and at first glance this might not seem ‘complex’ but it is not REST. As you read more, you will find out that I dispise ?params&amp;this=kind of urls - I find this harder to read than say /id/1/name/scrodinger (and it’s SEO friendly). But that asside, what makes this difficult to work with? First off, how many ‘verbs’ does cat have? For all I know we could have /cat/makeitjump.php and /cat/feedit.php and /cat/petit.php. We have opened up the world of unlimited actions, and actions can be complicated functions of a noun. Thus I say, keep it simple, stupid (KISS) and get back to the basics of CRUD.</p>\n<p>Service Orientied Minds\nIt seems that many service providers (Google, twitter, facebook) have switching to using something almost REST. Why? Accessability, ease of use, they like it better than SOAP? Who doesn’t like taking it easy better than cleaning? Another reason may be that developers don’t want services, they want structured data and scalability. This means developers can take <em>your</em> data and use it for their own purposes. They don’t want to learn your language and verbs [$client-&gt;getBoaConstrictor(324, ‘fQn’)]. Developers want the universal nouns and descriptions of those nouns without the head ache of  Isn’t data what computer’s are all about anyway? Managing, manipulating and corrupting raw data.</p>\n<p>“I want a system that is as simple as possible for everyone: from back-end developer (BEd) to front-end developer (FEd).” “And as generic as possible” “And a long jacket.”</p>\n<p>I propose using some MVC framework (in my example Zend) which can be used as a defacto API system for many (think CLOUD here) developers. It can sit on top of many heterogenous data sources concurrently (don’t think 1 data source 1 MVC app here). A csv or xml file can be a model resource, an oracle database table, a postgresql and mysql database - and all from the same system.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>RESTful controllers and models (Zend_Restful_Model_DbTable) to inherit from. This makes it simpler for the BEd to list configuration of models that are transformed into resources auto-magicaly. The developer can spend time explaining resources with annotations and less time writting code to access and manipulate data sources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Create security plugins that tie into existing frameworks. Facebook security, OAuth, Ldap, etc. I can update my configuration file (application.ini) and supply the minimal information for a plug-n-play effect. This means I supply you the configuration, everything else just works.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Web interface for managing access to resources. Some resources will be open to the world, others will be locked. The idea here is that you will have users on the system and each user can request keys to given locked resources. This is already coded and ready to go for the user.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Web interface for managing data sources. Administrators can easily add/edit (no removal) of new data sources from their pool of existing data sources. Removal of data sources means the removal of resources which should be treated as quasi-permenant and somewhat dependable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Documentation uses a documentor (with annotations) to auto-magically create documentation for the FEd. This also compiles information we know about resources and displays to a FEd. Take for example a database table. We can easily fetch the ‘adjectives’ of our resource and some example data to allow the FE developer more insight into how to fetch data from our resource. We can provide examples in different langagues (use cases) because our verb-age is limited and thus we can show how to fetch this resource in python, php, c++, jquery (javascript), and the list goes on and on. And the beauty of this is that the code to fetch/manipulate a resource RESTfully… the code is almost identical regardless of the resource being used. Documentation is a time killer, and no developer really likes to spend time compiling documentation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Apply magic methods ideology to REST. Unforunately, some browsers may or may not supply ‘data’ if you PUT or PATCH. How can we solve this? We can make magic methods to hack around (if everyone is doing it, then is it a hack?). For example: __method: PUT could be passed as a parameter to POST (this is how Ruby on Rails handles it). But I don’t want the developer to have to code this. So this is an example of how (see #1) implementing our own RESTful controllers, models, plugins can handle this type of workaround. The type of workaround that might take a developer extra time to implement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Sitemaps. This is a ‘WSDL’ for REST. It tells the FEd what resources are available (as hyper links) and each will show documentation. We call this context switching in Zend (for example, if we find that the call is an XmlHttpRequest then we automatically display json instead of say… html or xml).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>JSON. It is pracitcally universal. We aren’t going to worry about different markup langauges and content delivery so much, as JSON can be used in many languages, is easy to work with and thus my pick for data. Later the system can add context switches if we find this is needed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There are some resources which are not really structured data. They have an id and simply exist on the file system as a file (Zend_Restful_Model_File). However, we can still keep metadata about this file (which can be seen as an adjective). One example resource might be a png image file. This is not structed data by any means and perhaps it is a file served out to other users for some reason. But should we treat this resource any differently? We might still want to protect it (if needed) and provide it to users to GET, PUT, POST, DELETE. I know what you’re thinking. Apache .htaccess, right? And what about users who requested XHR but they get a png back? This is why the documentor would need to handle non-structured data. It can show them an example of requests (by making the real requests itself) and thus the developer can know from the documentation that this does not deliver JSON but a PNG instead.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Example Product\nSleepy DB. My RESTful Database implementation. This is my version of a RESTful database. It is your model(s). You can create, read, update, delete to any resourses you define. It has a UI that helps you crud resources as well. There are other databases (jasondb) which attempt to do RESTful db for the web but I have bigger plans for mine. Mainly, user friendli-ness. (You don’t have to be a developer to use it).</p>\n<p>Sleepy DB is built in Zend and has no databases. It simply uses my API system as a database for it’s models. All data models are built using the Restful API system (Zend_Restful_Model_Api) built and runs over HTTPS via the cloud. Data can be stored and protected and served to other users. It is very much like Dropbox, except that Dropbox does not provide documentation on every file. It seems that Dropbox would likely be a good Model from which a BEd could inherit from. Zend_Restful_Model_Dropbox. A developer could extend this class and provide only the configuration needed to use Dropbox as a model. (On second thought, who knows?)</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoyed my paper. I didn’t use big words to try and confuse anyone. I like simple. The biggest word I used I believe was hetrogenous data sources - which I meant different types of data sources - in case you missed that. And in case you missed it… the big picture idea is: simplify for everyone, generic enough for everyone. But if you missed the big picture then maybe you should read this paper again.</p>\n",

It was a pretty fun experience, we got to spend the day judging other’s code and lots of free food.</p>\n<p>During my recent computer cleaning, I found a few problems I wrote for the contest. I typically had some of the easier problems at the contest\n(there were about a dozen total problems).</p>\n<p>Therefore, I decided to share with you my three programming contest questions, 1) Dr. Bob’s Crazy People Party, 2) Palpatine’s Florist and 3) Modular Primes.</p>\n<!-- more --> \n<h3>Dr. Bob’s Crazy-People Party (2008)</h3>\n<p>{% blockquote %}This problem is a good example of where we should transform divide and conquer into dynamic programming or implement a top down memory function.{% endblockquote %}</p>\n<p>**Congratulations, you have been invited to Dr. Bob’s Crazy-People Party for Quixotic Number Crunchers! Unfortunately, in order to enter the party house you must first answer a question. Since you know Dr. Bob likes Fibonacci n-step numbers you assume that will be the question. You decide to write a program to calculate <code>Fn(x)</code> for you so you won’t be stuck outside the party.</p>\n<p><strong>Fibonacci n-step</strong> number is defined as:</p>\n<pre><code>Fn(1) = 1, Fn(2) = 1\nFn(x) = Fn(x-1) + Fn(x-2) + … + Fn(x-n)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Assume that <code>if x &lt;= 0 then Fn(x) = 0</code>, also don’t worry about <code>x &gt; n</code>, Bob isn’t <strong>that</strong> crazy</p>\n<p><strong>Some Examples</strong></p>\n<pre><code>F3(10) = F3(9) + F3(8) + F3(7)\n       = 81 + 44 + 24            # Notice, to find F3(9) we need to know F3(8) + F3(7) + F3(6)\n       = 149                     # And likewise for F3(8), F3(7), F3(6), …, F3(1)\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>(<strong>Hint:</strong> <code>Fn(x)</code> is recursive in nature; however, if you write the program recursively it will probably be too slow and you will miss the party if Dr. Bob asks for a high value of n or x)</p>\n<p>The program should loop until it sees a non-number input for n or x. Example, in order to end the program type q for the value of n or x. See below for some input/output examples.</p>\n<p><strong>Input/Output Examples</strong></p>\n<pre><code>n=7         n=5           n=10         n=30                 n=2        n=3\nx=10        x=20          x=12         x=41                 x=8        x=5\nans=149     ans=203513    ans=1023     ans=549755811072     ans=21     ans=7\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here is the gist of it:</p>\n<pre><code>$F1 = array(0 =&gt; 0, 1 =&gt; 1, 2 =&gt; 1);\n$Fn = array(1 =&gt; $F1);\n\nfunction Fn($step, $x)\n{\n\tglobal $Fn;\n\tif (!isset($Fn[$step][$x])) SeiveFn($step, $x);\n\treturn $Fn[$step][$x];\n}\n\necho Fn($n = 10, $x = 12);  // 1023\n</code></pre>\n<p>So what is this Seive? I named it this because of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes\">Sieve of Eratosthenes</a>. The idea is to remember the all the previous prime numbers you found in order to find the next. We aren’t dealing with prime numbers in this case but instead Fibonacci numbers but the idea is the same. This is a way to calculate the Fn for a specific <code>$n</code> and <code>$x</code> and store the results in a two dimensional array for next time we try to find another value for the pair ($n, $x).</p>\n<pre><code>function SeiveFn($step, $x)\n{\n\tglobal $Fn;\n\n\tif(!isset($Fn[$step]))\n\t{\n\t\tif(!isset($Fn[$step - 1])) SeiveFn($step - 1, $x);\n\t\t$Fn[$step] = $Fn[$step - 1];\n\t}\n\n\tfor($i = $step + 1; $i &lt;= $x; $i++)\n\t{\n\t\t$sum = 0;\n\t\tfor($n = $i - 1; $n &gt;= $i - $step; $n--) $sum = $sum + $Fn[$step][$n];\n\t\t$Fn[$step][$i] = $sum;\n\t}\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can see <a href=\"/media/programming-contest-questions/fibonacci-n-step.zip\">answer source code here in php</a>.</p>\n<h3>Emperor Palpatine’s Florist (2009)</h3>\n<p>You are a florist and you’ve received a call from Emperor Palpatine, something about executing <code>Order 66</code>. Basically he wants you to deliver flowers to certain Jedi warriors. However, you must deliver the flowers in a specific order, the first bouquet should go to the highest ranking Jedi, the second bouquet to the second highest, and so on down the chain of rank until the last flowers are delivered to the lowest ranking Jedi.</p>\n<p>In case you are unsure of rank (shame, shame), he has given you a list of Jedi names in two columns. This list compares two Jedi members and you should read this as, first Jedi rank &gt; second Jedi rank.</p>\n<p>Your list looks as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>Windu Mundi\nYoda Yaddle\nYoda Poof\nWindu Obi-wan\nYaddle Poof\nObi-wan Skywalker\nYoda Windu\nYaddle Obi-wan\nMundi Yaddle\nYoda Skywalker\nSkywalker Poof\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note: From the first line we can tell that Windu is higher rank than Mundi. Thus we should also infer that anyone lesser in rank than Mundi is also lesser rank than Windu.</p>\n<p>Return a list of names in order of rank based on this list above so you can deliver the flowers as the Emperor wishes. Be prepared to use another list in case the Emperor wants to add additional rankings to the list (don’t just do this by hand).</p>\n<p>You can see <a href=\"/media/programming-contest-questions/palpatine-florist.zip\">example solution for this in php</a>. The trick is just to print higher in rank, yourself, then everyone lower in rank and you keep a memory array to make sure you only print yourself once.</p>\n<pre><code>function sortList($keys, $list)\n{\n\t# get a list of people that are better than me then print my name\n\tforeach ($keys as $name) { whoIsBetter($name, $list); printJedi($name); }\n\n\t# get a list of people worse than me\n\tforeach ($keys as $name) { whoIsWorse($name, $list); }\n}\n\n$p = array(); # global variable to keep up with Jedi names we have printed\nfunction printJedi($name)\n{\n\tif($GLOBALS['p'][$name] != 1) print &quot;$name\\n&quot;;\n\t$GLOBALS['p'][$name] = 1;\n}\n\nfunction whoIsBetter($name, $list)\n{\n\tforeach ($list as $key =&gt; $value)\n\t{\n\t\tif($key != $name)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tforeach ($value as $item) { if($item == $name) printJedi(&quot;$key&quot;); }\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nfunction whoIsWorse($name, $list)\n{\n\tforeach ($list[$name] as $value){ printJedi($value); }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Modular Primes (2010)</h3>\n<p>I didn’t get very creative with this one. Essentially, I asked the teams to find the two smallest prime numbers which has a pattern found from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson's_theorem#Applications\">Wilson’s theorem</a>. See <a href=\"/media/programming-contest-questions/modular-primes.zip\">entire source code</a> or read the code below for more details. The first answer for range 2 through 10 would be 5039 because:</p>\n<pre><code>Answer: 5039\n   -&gt; 2 (2519) + 1 = 5039\n   -&gt; 3 (1679) + 2 = 5039\n   -&gt; 4 (1259) + 3 = 5039\n   -&gt; 5 (1007) + 4 = 5039\n   -&gt; 6 (839) + 5 = 5039\n   -&gt; 7 (719) + 6 = 5039\n   -&gt; 8 (629) + 7 = 5039\n   -&gt; 9 (559) + 8 = 5039\n   -&gt; 10 (503) + 9 = 5039\n</code></pre>\n<p>The teams had to find the next prime that matches this same pattern for range 2 to 10 and I asked to be able to check for other ranges besides 2 through 10.</p>\n<pre><code>/* Find primes P, with following pattern\n * 2(p2) + 1 = P\n * 3(p3) + 2 = P\n * 4(p4) + 3 = P\n * ...\n * N(pN) + (N-1) = P\n *\n * This is a variation of Wilson's theorem for a prime number 'n'\n *      (n-1)! = -1 mod n\n */\nfunction main()\n{\n\t$max = 10;    # check mod 2 - 10\n\t$i = 5000;    # start iterator at 5000 (I already know the answer and it is greater than 5000)\n\t$count = 2;   # how many primes should we find with this pattern?\n\n\twhile ($count != 0)\n\t{\n\n\t\t# find a possible answer\n\t\t$answer = $i;\n\t\tfor($n=2; $n&lt;=$max; $n++)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tif ($i % $n != ($n-1)) { $answer = 0; break; }\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t# check to see if this is an answer and also primality\n\t\tif($answer == $i &amp;&amp; isPrime($answer))\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tprint &quot;Answer: $answer\\n&quot;;\n\t\t\tfor($n=2; $n&lt;=$max; $n++)\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t$mod = $answer % $n;\n\t\t\t\t$divisor=($answer - $mod)/$n;\n\n\t\t\t\tprint &quot; -&gt; $n ($divisor) + $mod = &quot; . $answer ;\n\t\t\t\tprint &quot;\\n&quot;;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tprint &quot;\\n&quot;;\n\t\t\t$count--;\n\t\t}\n\t\t$i++;\n\t}\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>That wraps it up. It was fun being a contest judge. As I said earlier, my questions were usually among the first answered. Not having your question answered at all just means it was too complex anyway and what’s the point of that? The goal is to see how well people can program - not to attempt to baffle and frustrate a team for five hours.</p>\n",

Below are some items that I played a part in.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<h3>SIS (Student Information System) Integration with Snapshot</h3>\n<p>Blackboard can capture students, faculty, courses, roles and various other things from the student information system using the Snapshot tool. Our group had a three weeks to discuss the business rules and logic behind synchronization and work out the technical details on how this would be accomplished. Later I was trained on the snapshot override client which allows exceptions and one-off feed files to Blackboard.</p>\n<h3>Community and Content Engagement</h3>\n<p>I attended several Blackboard training sessions and one certificate online course about the Content and Community piece of Blackboard. This piece allows us to setup institutional roles and group users into that role. Once these roles are in place, we can target users and release information (via modules and tabs) only to those certain individuals within the role.</p>\n<h3>3rd Party Building Block Integration/Development</h3>\n<p>Building Blocks are Blackboard’s way of adding customization. You can think of them as “plug-ins.” There are various places you can get these Building Blocks - you can develop your own or download from vendors, such as those on <a href=\"http://www.blackboard.com/partnerships/extensions.aspx\">Blackboard Extensions</a>. There is even an <a href=\"http://projects.oscelot.org/gf/\">open source website called Oscelot</a> which developers release Building Blocks for free public download. However, a problem that often rises is that someone has to setup, configure and support these Building Blocks and then learn how it best utilized for other users. We used many B2’s including McGraw Hill, Wimba and Blackboard Collaborate, Section Merge Tool, ASTRO, BbStats, Impersonate, Blackboard Mobile and many more.</p>\n<div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-8\">\nOne example of how I used open source building blocks to better our users is B2WebCT, which was developed by [Stephen Vickers](http://www.spvsoftwareproducts.com/). We had one year of co-production on both Blackboard CE8 and 9.1. This meant two different websites for users. The problem was that students and teachers would become confused because they didn't know where their course was located (in CE8 or 9.1).\n<p>The B2WebCT Building Block fixed this problem by allowing us to place a module on the 9.1 webpage that single-signs-on the users to CE8. Thus, we were able to point every user to 9.1 and they could see a list of courses on <strong>both</strong> systems! <em>And everyone was pleased.</em></p>\n</div><div class=\"col-md-4\">\n<a data-lightbox=\"blackboard-migration-project\" href=\"/media/blackboard-migration-project/blackboard.png\"><img class=\"full-width\" src=\"/media/blackboard-migration-project/blackboard.png\"></a>\n</div></div>\n<h3>System Administration Advanced Configuration</h3>\n<p>There were many things I did to help simplify the lives of our instructional designers, technical staff and faculty members. Here are a few I can remember…</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Course Templates (using snapshot tool, we can provide course templates based on rules)</li>\n<li>Tool Availability (which tools should we use?)</li>\n<li>Branding (helped with troublesome CSS and staged a “frozen pristine” development server for our <a href=\"http://jennovate.it/\">graphics designer</a>)</li>\n<li>Managed things like orphaned content, specialized system roles and other various settings.</li>\n<li>Cut down on migrated course sizes with quotas and active reporting - including SQL database queries</li>\n<li>Setting up a course archival process (there was always talk about this, but I made it happen)</li>\n</ul>\n",

Again, simplicity is king here.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Reinforce with stories, statistics and examples.</p>\n<p>These three steps can be applied to other things as well. For example, education. What would happen if we design our class around these steps? Cut out the powerpoints and paragraphs. Stick to the bare necessities. Stick to examples and stories.</p>\n<p>What if we applied these steps to software design? Too often I see co-workers skipping to programming language specifics or server operating systems before even simplifying what is they need to do (I’m guilty of this myself).</p>\n<p>I’m going to jot down these steps and try them out in a upcoming few meetings, I want to see <strong>how well</strong> they work.

This isn’t really a big deal I suppose, but if we follow the Einstein minimalism principle rule, this whole process could be simpler therefore it is not truly elegant.</p>\n<p>So what if I went a different route? What if Laravel had a compser packagist package available to do watches? For example, if I forked/modified something like <a href=\"https://github.com/dbergey/Reloadr\">https://github.com/dbergey/Reloadr</a>. No grunt, no problem.

The idea is simple, don’t make your users fill out a crap load of stuff. These sites all pay big bucks for A|B testing. Guess what?</p>\n<p><strong>None of them make you confirm your password during sign up.</strong></p>\n</div></div>\n<p>Still not convinced? Let’s take a step back think about function. What is even the point of a sign up page? It’s most likely to get a user into your system so you can have them <em>do stuff</em> right?</p>\n<p>Assume we aren’t going to use oAuth for whatever reason and we are going to have a sign up page. We probably want a low barrier of entry. That means having no wizards, fewest fields possible - <em>a real wam bam thank ya ma’am sign up</em>.</p>\n<p>Let me ask you, how often do you mistype your password when signing up for something new? Most people use the same few passwords for all their websites, so they are seasoned veterans at typing their password. People make mistakes though so password recovery is important. If your site doesn’t have a way to recover a password, then confirming the user got their password correct would be pretty important. For example, when you’re signing up for a Gmail account, you have to type your password twice. That’s because it’s a lot harder to retrieve a password for email systems Where would you send a password recovery email to if you get locked out of your email?</p>\n<p>I’m also a big fan of designing for the masses. We shouldn’t annoy 80% of the population by making them type their password twice, just because 20% of the population can’t type it right. Those 20% deserve to go reset it a few times, they need typing practice anyway. ^_^</p>\n<p>If I still haven’t convinced you… try reading <a href=\"http://www.leemunroe.com/confirm-passwords-signup/\">some</a> other <a href=\"http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/20953/why-should-we-ask-the-password-twice-during-registration\">places</a>.</p>\n",

Notice below the code is almost identical except I cut out the <code>this.listenTo</code> and just use a <code>this.listenAll</code></p>\n<pre><code>App.module('Sidebar.Show', function(Show, App, Backbone, Marionette, $, _) {\n    Show.Controller = Marionette.Controller.extend({\n        initialize : function() {\n            var foobars = App.request('foobar:entities');\n            var view = new Show.View();\n\n            App.execute('when:done', foobars, function() {\n                App.Region_Content.show(view);\n            });\n\n            this.listenAll(view);\n        },\n\n        onSomeEvent : function() {\n            // ...\n        },\n\n        onSomethingClicked : function() {\n            // ...\n        }\n\n        onSomethingElse : function() {\n            // ...\n        }\n\n    });\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>So now that you see how <code>listenAll</code> works, the next logical question is, how do I get it into my marionette application? Easy, just use the code below. Notice I’m not doing a <code>Marionette.Controller.extend({})</code> here primarily because I like this function so much I wanted it baked naively into the <code>Marionette.Controller</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>Marionette.Controller.prototype.listenAll = function(obj) {\n    var controller = this;\n\n    this.listenTo(obj, 'all', function() {\n        controller.triggerMethod.apply(this, arguments)\n    });\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>That about sums it up. The last thing I’d like to say is that the <code>triggerMethod</code> function is pretty neat. There is a lot that can be learned by just skimming through the <a href=\"http://marionettejs.com/docs/backbone.marionette.html\">Marionette annotated source</a>.</p>\n",

You’ll have to setup node, npm install grunt-cli and configure a Gruntfile. This isn’t that bad. I guess I’m crazy mad and wanted to toy around with asynchronous php.</p>\n<p>Also think about how interesting it could be to setup an event handler to watch files on a disk space and asynchronously add rows in your database anytime those files changed?</p>\n<pre><code>class CrazyEloquentGuardEvent implements EventInterface\n{\n        public function start($watcher)\n        {\n                // nothing to do here when guard firsts starts up\n        }\n \n        public function stop()\n        {\n                // nothing to do here when guard first stops\n        }\n \n        public function listen($event)\n        {\n                CrazyGuardLogModel::create([\n                   'resource' =&gt; $event-&gt;getResource(),\n                   'change_type' =&gt; $event-&gt;getTypeString(),\n                ]);\n        }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Reactive Programming</h3>\n<p>Programming to an event loop in php is wild. It is also extremely powerful. I love the asynchronous aspect of node.js but it has drawbacks too. One drawback is the complexity. Anyone who has worked in both express and Laravel would likely tell you that Laravel is easier to use - I certainly would.</p>\n<p>However, the benefits of an event loop frees us from waiting on things. Here is how I handled an event loop in React for the LiveReload server. I also used Ratchet for the WebSockets server which piggy backs off React. The only reason I am tampering with the React server here is so that I can have more control over what goes into the Event Loop.</p>\n<pre><code>public function start()\n{\n\t$config = $this-&gt;config;\n\t$loop = \\React\\EventLoop\\Factory::create();\n\t$app = new \\Ratchet\\App($config['host'], $config['port'], $config['host'], $loop);\n \n\tforeach ($config['routes'] as $route)\n\t{\n\t\tcall_user_func_array(array($app, 'route'), $route);\n\t}\n \n\t$loop-&gt;addTimer($config['timeout'], array($this, 'watchTempFile'));\n\t$app-&gt;run();\t\t\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you’d really like to dig in, you can see the full extent of the code in the <a href=\"https://github.com/CodeSleeve/guard-live-reload/blob/master/src/Codesleeve/GuardLiveReload/LiveReloadServer.php#L31\">codesleeve/guard-livereload</a> repository. I may change this eventually, but I think I’ll re-architect the entire thing if I do. Basically the react event loop cannot be an external process fired by codesleeve/guard, instead it guard needs to become itself an event loop and I will have to compartmentalize all the different events and configs together so that it is easy to drop in new event handlers. It’s do-able I believe but right now isn’t any where on my priority list of todos.</p>\n",

There is no logic in a controller, period.</p>\n<pre><code>A controller is much like your UPS man. He is given an address (the route) and delivers a box (model+view) to your address. He doesn't need worry about the contents of the box.\n</code></pre>\n<p>But then you say, the UPS guy still makes decisions. For example, if it is currently raining, the box might end up in your car otherwise probably on your front porch.</p>\n<pre><code>So where then do you put your logic? I call them *scenarios* but they are also called *use cases*. Uncle Bob calls them *interceptors*.\n</code></pre>\n</div><div class=\"col-md-3\"><img class=\"full-width\" src=\"/media/hexagonal-pattern-design-scenarios/controller.png\" alt=\"concept of routing and controllers\">\n\t<small>This diagram taken from the blog shows the separation of delivery and application.</small>\n</div></div>\n<p>So let’s use our concept of a Scenario with our contrived UPS example. Instead of the UPS guy trying to figure out what to do with the box, he simply follows a strict set of predetermined guidelines given the scenario. He makes no assumptions and does exactly as he is told. So in the scenario in which it is raining, his rules are to leave a pretty note explaining the situation and not leave the package in the rain. This means the UPS guy is not responsible for any decisions. He is just a delivery mechanism following orders.</p>\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\n<p>Below are two classes: UserController and UserScenario. This walks through how a user might be created in Laravel using our Hexagonal pattern with Scenarios.</p>\n<pre><code>class UserController extends BaseController implements HexagonalInterface\n{\n   public function __construct(UserScenario $scenario)\n   {\n      $this-&gt;scenario = $scenario;\n      $scenario-&gt;setDelegate($this);\n   }\n\n   public function create()\n   {\n      $user = $this-&gt;scenario-&gt;emptyUser();\n      $this-&gt;layout-&gt;nest('content', 'user.create', compact('user'));\n   }\n\n   public function store()\n   {\n      return $this-&gt;scenario-&gt;createUser(Input::get());\n   }\n\n   protected function createInvalid($validator, $input)\n   {\n      return Redirect::action('UserController@create')-&gt;withErrors($validator)-&gt;withInput($input);\n   }\n\n   protected function createSuccess($user)\n   {\n      Auth::loginUsingId($user-&gt;id);\n      return Redirect::action('HomeController@dashboard');\n   }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>That handles the controller aspect of this but you’re probably wondering what a <code>UserScenario</code> looks like.</p>\n<pre><code>class UserScenario extends BaseScenario\n{\n  public function __construct(User $user)\n  {\n    parent::__construct();\n    $this-&gt;user = $user;\n  }\n\n  public function emptyUser()\n  {\n    return $this-&gt;user;\n  }\n\n  public function createUser($input)\n  {\n    $validation = $this-&gt;validator($input, $this-&gt;user-&gt;creationRules);\n\n    if ($validation-&gt;fails()) {\n       return $this-&gt;invoke('createInvalid', [$validation, $input]);\n    }\n\n    $this-&gt;user-&gt;create($input);\n\n    return $this-&gt;invoke('createSuccess', [$user]);\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>You might be wondering what the <code>invoke()</code> function is? It comes from my BaseScenario class.</p>\n<pre><code>class BaseScenario\n{\n  protected $delegate = null;\n\n  public function __construct(Input $input = null)\n  {\n    $this-&gt;input = $input ?: App::make('Input');\n  }\n\n  protected function validator($input, $rules, $messages = [])\n  {\n    return Validator::make($input, $rules, $messages);\n  }\n\n  protected function invoke($methodName, $args)\n  {\n    $obj = $this-&gt;getDelegate();\n    $method = new ReflectionMethod(get_class($obj), $methodName);\n    $method-&gt;setAccessible(true);\n    return $method-&gt;invokeArgs($obj, $args);\n  }\n\n  public function getDelegate()\n  {\n    return $this-&gt;delegate);\n  }\n\n  public function setDelegate(HexagonalInterface $delegate)\n  {\n    $this-&gt;delegate = $delegate;\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The reflection allows me to see the actions which should not have routes tied to them, i.e. <code>createInvalid</code> should not have a route and thus is a protected function. So there you have it, logic-less controllers using Scenarios.</p>\n<aside class=\"important\">Honestly this pattern can be extreme overkill. Notice how we have to keep switching back and forth between the scenario and controllers just to figure out what is going on. They are loosely coupled but still coupled. Sure we have a logic-less controller but hopefully you can see how this is still complicated in some ways.</aside>\n<p>Hopefully I didn’t scare you off with this post. There are still two more posts to go! In the next post I will be talking about how to keep Laravel views simple and clean using macros.</p>\n",

No more logic in our views, it’s all evaluating variables now and all the logic has been extracted away. This makes testing a breeze, as we don’t have to worry about conditional structure in our view - assuming the variables are in place then the system just works.</p>\n<p>This is a simple view in the first place but we can <strong>always</strong> extract out conditional logic from a view. That really only leaves foreach/loop logic, but that doesn’t bother me as much as conditionals so I usually leave those in place if they are simple. You <strong>could</strong> though create a <a href=\"http://laravel.com/docs/html#custom-macros\">macro</a> to help with loops if you really wanted to do so.

Well, I have made a <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/kdocki/ccdfacd391b143dbb7f7#file-macros-php\">macros.php gist</a> to share with you guys. Now send me a beer. ^_^</p>\n<pre><code>/**\n * HTML::show_message_when('first_name', $errors)\n */\nHTML::macro('show_message_when', function show_message_when($name, $errors, $attributes = array())\n{\n    $attributes_string = &quot;&quot;;\n    $content_string = &quot;&quot;;\n \n    $attributes['class'] = isset($attributes['class']) ?: &quot;&quot;;\n    $attributes['class'] .= &quot; $name&quot;;\n \n    if ($errors-&gt;has($name))\n    {\n        $attributes['class'] .= &quot; alert&quot;;\n        $attributes['class'] .= &quot; alert-danger&quot;;\n        $content_string = $errors-&gt;first($name);\n    }\n \n    foreach ($attributes as $key =&gt; $value) {\n        $attributes_string = &quot; $key = \\&quot;&quot; . $value . &quot;\\&quot;&quot;; \n    }\n \n    return &quot;&lt;div $attributes_string&gt;$content_string&lt;/div&gt;&quot;;\n});\n \n \n/**\n * HTML::foreach('user', 'user.itemview', $users)\n */\nHTML::macro('foreach', function($name, $view, $items)\n{\n    var html = &quot;&quot;;\n \n    foreach ($items as $item)\n    {\n       html .= View::make($view, [$name =&gt; $item]);\n    }\n \n    return html;\n});\n \n/**\n * HTML::not_found($users, 'No users found!')\n */\nHTML::macro('not_found', function($items, $message = 'None found!')\n{\n   return '&lt;div class=&quot;empty row&quot;&gt;' . $message . '&lt;/div&gt;';\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>So that about wraps it up.  I use macros all the time in my views. You don’t always have to use <code>HTML::macro</code> either. In fact, one macro I use often is just a normal function which I call like <code>active(...)</code> or <code>HTML::active(...)</code> and it allows me to set a class to active when we are visiting the right place.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;li class=&quot;&lt;?= active(&quot;foobar.index&quot;) ?&gt;&quot;&gt;\n\t&lt;a href=&quot;&lt;?= route(&quot;foobar.index&quot;) ?&gt;&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-eye&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n\t\t&lt;span class=&quot;hidden-sm&quot;&gt;My Watchlists&lt;/span&gt;\n\t&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/li&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>If you didn’t get anything else out of this besides the fact that you can use macros to keep your views clean then I think I can pat myself on the back. Now go, change the world my friend! My next blog will be talking about using presenters to keep views clean in the hexagonal pattern.</p>\n",

First make sure you absolutely need the single page application. Chances are you can do without it. However, let’s say you want to do a lot of javascript client-side intensive stuff, then how should you decide what framework to use? I’ve been in this same scenario myself multiple times, so I decided to blog about it. I have a love-hate relationship with all 3 of these frameworks because I have used all of them on work and personal projects. I only focus on client side frameworks here, not server side, e.g. meteor, sailsjs, express. I only included the frameworks I have the most experience with.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<h3>Angular</h3>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-6\">\n**Love**\n<p><strong>If I’ve already got a server side page built and I just want to fancy up the UX</strong> with some dynamic features, e.g. - adding a new text box when I push a button, this is super simple with ng bindings.</p>\n<p><strong>Two way data-binding is pretty awesome.</strong> If we couple this with <code>$resource</code> or <code>$http</code> then we have simple model-view layer with persistence with very little effort.</p>\n<p><strong>Dependency injection keeps the code nice and clean</strong> but it sucks that you end up having to attach a bunch of extra strings to your controllers just so you can minify code and not break things.</p>\n</div><div class=\"col-md-6\">\n**Hate**\n<p><strong>Creating a custom directive for an existing jquery plugin.</strong> I can go download a jquery plugin like jquery.colorwheel.js and have this thing up and running in minutes. But not if I have to go write an angular directive for it - I already deal with too many 3rd party plugins as it is without having to write my own angular interfaces for them.</p>\n<p><strong>Routing in angular is a pain to me.</strong> I don’t like the ngRoute service and I have to go study the docs just for routes. Angular seems to work better for me when I let the server-side tackle routing.</p>\n<p><strong>Obtrusive javascript is somewhat of a code smell to me.</strong> Sure it is easy to use but it still couples the presentation layer (html page) with logic. If you think about it, <code>&lt;button ng-click=&quot;foobar&quot;&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;button onclick=&quot;foobar&quot;&gt;</code> are both still obtrusive.</p>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Ember</h3>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-6\">\n**Love**\n<p><strong>How easy it is to get going.</strong> For me, Ember comes the closest to behaving like a server-side MVC framework. You have routes, controllers, views, models, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Naming conventions are very nice.</strong> If you follow the standard naming conventions which are very similar to Rails, then it makes coding with Ember so much easier.</p>\n<p><strong>Handlebar templating is what I primarily use.</strong> However what if I wanted to switch this to a different templating language? I hear HTMLbars will solve a lot of problems with Handlebars.</p>\n<p><strong>Chrome dev tools integration is very very awesome.</strong> It helps me speed up troubleshooting and I have a clear picture of what is going on inside my application just be inspecting chrome tools. Angular has one of these tools as well, but I haven’t used it all that much.</p>\n<p>Tom Dale and Yehuda Katz are programming heroes of mine. We all have developers that we listen closely to what they have to say. These guys are very opinionated about their development styles</p>\n<p><strong>Testing in ember is not an after-thought.</strong> The guys have documentation and examples. I have played with karma, jasmine and phantomjs and a framework that promotes BDD or TDD is pretty awesome in my opinion. The guys at angular use testacular so they get + points for that.</p>\n<p><strong>Ember community in IRC (<a href=\"http://irc.freenode.net\">irc.freenode.net</a> #emberjs) is very helpful.</strong> I have found that #emberjs has more activity than #angular and #documentcloud and these guys are pretty helpful.</p>\n<p><strong>Ember is very promising.</strong> To me this framework seems to be the most promising. It still has a lot of things to figure out and is still a bit unstable but with HTMLbars on the rise and the level of awareness this framework has gotten in the past year, I know Ember is just going to keep getting better and better.</p>\n</div><div class=\"col-md-6\">\n**Hate**\n<p><strong>My biggest complaint is how difficult it is to bring in a jquery plugin.</strong> This probably needs some explanation. Let’s use jquery.chosen plugin as an example.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://emberjs.jsbin.com/xiguxemu/3/edit\">First, checkout this jsbin example I made using chosen plugin.</a></p>\n<p>Like many other jquery plugins, the chosen plugin manipulates the DOM which ultimately means that we can’t call <code>$('element').chosen()</code> until after</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the models have been fetched</li>\n<li>and the handlebar template rendered into DOM</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So at what stage do you call the chosen plugin in Ember?  In Marionette, this is trivial as we have this nifty little hook called <code>onRender</code> where we can setup a jquery plugin once a view has rendered.</p>\n<p>Scourging through documentation and stackoverflow pages and pestering people on IRC, I finally find there is a function called <code>didInsertElement</code> along with</p>\n<p><code>Ember.run.scheduleOnce('afterRender',this, this.onRender)</code></p>\n<p>which seem to work great - <strong>except if you don’t change routes this never executes!</strong> This is all very confusing to me.</p>\n<p>After some searching I find some options from <a href=\"http://www.justinball.com/2013/10/07/using-chosen-with-ember.js/\">some random blog on the internet</a>. On top of this, because Ember junks up your DOM with &lt;script&gt; tags then it later pollutes the DOM so you have to modify the chosen.js source code to ignore that. Now I decide I want the ability to bring in custom tags so I need to switch to select2.js and I am in the same boat again. <em>Lots of frustration here just to bring in a simple jquery plugin.</em></p>\n<p>Lastly, I could just pray that some poor unforunately soul has had this same exact frustration has me and created a special handlebars helper or something (<a href=\"http://addepar.github.io/#/ember-widgets/select\">which sure enough one exists</a>).</p>\n<p>Having a simple process like <code>onRender</code> that is called anytime a view and using an unobtrustive templating engine like HTMLbars will be a game changer for me. We have to remember that single page applications are very likely to have lots of 3rd party plugins in them.</p>\n<p>If you have a jquery plugin that messes with the DOM (which most do), then chances are you are going to bang your head against the wall at least once trying to get Ember to work with it.</p>\n<p><strong>Putting logic in handlebars views makes things difficult.</strong> This isn’t really Ember’s fault but it is pretty easy to create some crazy wicked nested views full of #if #else and eventually you find yourself tracing through handlebar templates and cursing it simultaneously.</p>\n<p><strong>Emberscript pre-compliation is a custom fork of coffeescript and can be buggy.</strong> Writing annotations just to save several lines of code and then running through several stages of pre-compliation is not my ideal workflow for writing javascript applications. I prefer a generator over annotations any day because:</p>\n<p><span class=\"lg\"><em>I prefer 20 lines of simple, readable code over 5 lines of complex code.</em></span></p>\n</div></div>\n<h3>Marionette</h3>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"row\"><div class=\"col-md-6\">\n**Love**\n<p><strong>Composite style architecture can scale.</strong> You can write 100k line of code applications with Marionette. Modules which can be dynamically included/excluded, a lot like operating system. Derick Bailey is another one of my programming heroes and knows the importance of architecture.</p>\n<p><strong>Marionette stays out of my way.</strong> It is probably the easiest framework for me to bring in other 3rd party plugins because it doesn’t make me adhere to a scope like angular and I have complete control over when views are rendered.</p>\n<p><strong>Focused by design.</strong> What does this even mean? It means that I don’t have to shift through pages of documentation to understand what Marionette and Backbone can do. The docs are all on a single github page and can be read front-to-back in probably less than an hour.</p>\n<p>So what does Marionette do? I’ve made a list.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Organize your views into either <code>Regions</code>, <code>Layouts</code>, <code>ItemViews</code>, <code>CompositeViews</code> or <code>CollectionViews</code>.</li>\n<li>Organize your application so you can bubble up events from <code>views -&gt; controllers -&gt; application</code>.</li>\n<li>Organize event handling with Backbone.wreqr for application-wide message bus</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Simple right? Marionette has no opinion about your model/persistence later and relies completely on Backbone for this. There are a lot of things in Marionette you will have to go find elsewhere, like how to handle promises, routing and persistence. You won’t find things like <em>two-way data-binding</em> or <em>computed properties</em> out of the box with Marionette.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there are Backbone plugins out there for these types of features. <a href=\"https://github.com/kdocki/backbone.model.computed\">Heck I even wrote one myself</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Brian Mann’s videos show you how to make an enterprise worthy application.</strong> When I was first learning Marionette I was confused. I didn’t know how it should be used, and then I saw these videos and it improved not only my Marionette skills but my overall performance as a developer in Laravel and other frameworks.</p>\n</div><div class=\"col-md-6\">\n**Hate**\n<p><strong>Composite style architecture is complex.</strong> There is a reason people like MVC frameworks. They know to find their models, they can view <code>app/models</code>. To find controllers, <code>app/controllers</code>. Marionette has no structure except for that you give it. Creating a new Marionette single page application can be a daunting task to start with just because you have to organize your code with intent. <em>You don’t just drop a file in models/users.js but instead  face the challenge of how to broadcast the users entity?</em></p>\n<p><strong>Routing as an afterthought is something <em>Derick Bailey</em> and <em>Brian Mann</em> evangelize.</strong> I can’t say I agree 100% because routing is an essential part of single page applications. The reason why this bothers me is that when you rely solely on events to do your routing then it takes a <span class=\"lg\">lot more</span> time.</p>\n<p>For example, if you have route to #users and write a link <code>&lt;a href=&quot;#users&quot;&gt;Users&lt;/a&gt;</code> in your navigation then you are done. Simple right? But in Marionette the preffered thinking seems to be that we should</p>\n<ol>\n<li>listen to an event on <code>&lt;a class=&quot;js-clicked&quot;&gt;Users&lt;/a&gt;</code> DOM element inside of the users’ <code>Item</code>/<code>Collection</code>/<code>Composite</code> View</li>\n<li>bubble the event up using a trigger to parent controller.</li>\n<li>parent controller listens for triggers on child views.</li>\n<li>the controller would handle a trigger from child view in a function and take necessary action, which would to be call some event like <code>App.vent.trigger('!route:to:users')</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If none of that makes sense to you then you aren’t alone. Basically, it is a lot of work for something as simple as routing.</p>\n<p><strong>Testing in Marionette can be wearisome.</strong> Unlike Ember, which has the Chrome dev tools integration, in order to test I have to set breakpoints and follow execution and that can prove to be difficult since there are many events flying around everywhere. Often times I find myself just doing <code>console.log</code>. Also I have tried using karma/mocha with Marionette and because the <code>Marionette.Application</code> is a singleton it is hard to test in isolation.</p>\n</div></div>\n<h3>So which one should I use?</h3>\n<p>Depending on the application I am trying to build I would pick one of these three.</p>\n<p><strong>When to use Angular?</strong> If I’m just trying to add a simple UX feature that I want some two-way data binding then I might bring in angularjs. But I wouldn’t want to do a lot of routing and client-side templating with it. Another thing I wouldn’t want to do is create custom directive. This might work well for teams that are strictly dedicated to Angular, but our team definitely does not fit that bill.</p>\n<p><strong>When to use Ember?</strong> If I want to create a more MVC looking front-end client with lots of routing then Ember would be my choice. Ember is great to start prototyping with. It is really fast to get started with but as the application grows, if you are not careful, then it will become increasingly more difficult to work with. Also be prepared to read a lot of docs, blog posts, stack overflows and watch a lot of videos <strong>because Ember is the richest (feature-wise) of these 3 frameworks</strong> and will take a while for you to become comfortable with. An example of this is Ember model (DS data store). You can define your has many/belongs to relationships on the client side if you wanted to. I’ve not found a good reason to do this yet though. Also instead of following RESTful standards it does something called side-loading so <strong>be prepared to write your own Adapter for Ember</strong> or handle data in a custom way on the server-side. Honestly, I have not done much with Ember model as you can just use plain ol’ javascript objects with Ember too. You can even use <code>Backbone.Model</code> with it.</p>\n<p><strong>When to use Marionette?</strong> You might be curious to see how the composite design pattern will work on your application but I would <strong>only pick Marionette if you (and your team) are very comfortable with javascript.</strong> If you use Marionette you should be ready to <strong>use lots of additional plugins</strong> and watch Brian Mann’s videos on a good way to organize your marionette application. You can easily bring in lots of jquery plugins without having to worry about the DOM being messed and you will know you are in complete control of your DOM because there is not a whole lot of magic going on behind the scenes with Marionette since you are having to wire up the different types of views yourself.</p>\n<p>Above all else, no matter the framework you choose, <strong>test your code</strong>. A feature rich client side architecture will need tests just like a server side architecture. This is one area Marionette seems to lack guidance. I have seen many more tutorials for Ember and Angular on testing than Marionette. But it is still possible using jasmine or mocha to crank out a test suite in all 3 of these client side frameworks. Good luck, amigos.</p>\n",

A lot. So much in fact that it is killing me. I want to stand more. I want to move more.\n{% endblockquote %}</p>\n<p>From the desperation found in the quote above, one thing was clear - I desired change. I won’t go into details but my health was the primary reason I was seeking out standing desks.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<p>I spend most of my day at my desk, writing code, working on projects, and in Hangouts. It’s my profession. If I’m not slinging code, then I’m not producing anything. I love working from home, it’s flexible but that doesn’t mean I don’t spend a good part of my days working.</p>\n<p>So after searching for a while I found there was plenty of options for a standing desk. I could <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/build-your-own-electric-standing-desk-1305005648\">build my own</a>, buy a stationary standing desk so that I have two desks, one for standing and one for sitting or pick from various desks, such as, <a href=\"http://www.nextdesks.com/video/adjustable-height-desk-terra\">NextDesk</a>, <a href=\"https://myupdesk.com/upwrite\">UpDesk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.geekdesk.com/\">GeekDesk</a>.</p>\n<h3>Build vs. Buy</h3>\n<p>I wouldn’t try to construct my own bed. Why? Because I want it to be comfortable and functional. I spend on average eight hours a day in my bed. The same logic applies to my desk. The old desk I was using was built by my own hands, and I’m man enough to admit that I’m no professional craftsman. It was made from mdf board I painted, some bolts I purchased from Home Depot and some metal brackets from an old yardsale desk my wife had salvaged. We recently moved in the last few months and I’m surprised it even survived the move. So I was determined to purchase my next desk.</p>\n<h3>What Desk Should I Purchase?</h3>\n<p>I looked at various standing desks from like IKEA because I though this would be easier on the pocketbook. However, two different desks means two different workspaces which was an immediate turn off for me. I have a three monitor setup and a kick ass Ubuntu system that I develop with. How do I get that same kick ass workspace on two desks? Buy an additional three more monitors and do some sort of kvm/splitter setup or a different desktop machine? No, I wanted to keep it simple. <strong>One desk, one workspace</strong>. Also my office only has room for one desk. Thus I decided I wanted a desk which could slide up and down between sitting and standing positions.</p>\n<p>I had seen a GeekDesk in action before from an old colleague, so it was the first thing I went to. But after reading <a href=\"http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-standing-desks/\">thewirecutter</a>, I sought out a different desk. I have pretty high standards and some aspects important to me,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>look and feel</em> - I will make contact with my desk more throughout the day than my wife . My wife is easy on the eyes, has beautiful curves, and nonabrasive soft skin that is calming yet exciting. I expect no less from my desk.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>i like to move it, move it</em> - If I want to sit, stand, stand, sit, stand, stand, sit throughout my day then I need to easily move positions at anytime. It cannot be any hassle to move up and down or the desk has failed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>easily cleaned</em> - I believe that a tidy desk makes me more productive. Having little toys, bills/papers, or pci express cards strung about my desk only distracts me from the real tasks at hand.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>single purposed</em> - I will often eat lunch at my desk. If my whole point of getting a standing desk is to be healthier and move around more, then why would I go back to my desk to sit down and eat lunch? I want my desk to be simply a place of work. Not my dinner table and not my coffin.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>organization</em> - My old desk had a filing cabinet drawer. One might think that this would help with organization. Unfortunately, this was not the case. My daughter often comes running into my office when the door is left open and what once was a full drawer full of paperwork, cables and various electronics quickly becomes an empty drawer. Having a desk with no drawers forces me to place these things somewhere else. I can put my receipts and paperwork in our real filing cabinet. I can put cables and electronics in storage bins with the other cables. What real purpose does a drawer on a desk serve a web designer? Simple: I throw crap I don’t want visible into the drawers and forget about it. Solution: I get off my butt and put the crap where it really needs to go.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What did I do?</h3>\n<p>After searching a while, I noticed that the UpDesk was stationed out of Nashville, TN. And it just so happens that I to go on business trips to Nashville, TN. I took that opportunity to stop by the warehouse for UpDesk and got a first-hand tour of these amazing desks. They didn’t have a show room but after ringing a doorbell this guy named Kamron shows up and lets me walk right into the office space where the employees all utilize fruits of their own labor; each employee had a different style of desk. I really enjoyed what I saw and decided that this was the desk for me. I had a large whiteboard UpWrite desk custom made and after four weeks of anticipation it was ready. Here are some pictures.</p>\n<p>{%raw %}\n<a class=\"inline thumbnail\" data-lightbox=\"updesk\" href=\"/media/my-standing-desk/1.jpg\"><img class=\"cropped\" src=\"/media/my-standing-desk/1_s.jpg\"></a>\n<a class=\"inline thumbnail\" data-lightbox=\"updesk\" href=\"/media/my-standing-desk/2.jpg\"><img class=\"cropped\" src=\"/media/my-standing-desk/2_s.jpg\"></a>\n<a class=\"inline thumbnail\" data-lightbox=\"updesk\" href=\"/media/my-standing-desk/3.jpg\"><img class=\"cropped\" src=\"/media/my-standing-desk/3_s.jpg\"></a>\n<a class=\"inline thumbnail\" data-lightbox=\"updesk\" href=\"/media/my-standing-desk/4.jpg\"><img class=\"cropped\" src=\"/media/my-standing-desk/4_s.jpg\"></a>\n<a class=\"inline thumbnail\" data-lightbox=\"updesk\" href=\"/media/my-standing-desk/5.jpg\"><img class=\"cropped\" src=\"/media/my-standing-desk/5_s.jpg\"></a>\n<a class=\"inline thumbnail\" data-lightbox=\"updesk\" href=\"/media/my-standing-desk/6.jpg\"><img class=\"cropped\" src=\"/media/my-standing-desk/6_s.jpg\"></a>\n<a class=\"inline thumbnail\" data-lightbox=\"updesk\" href=\"/media/my-standing-desk/7.jpg\"><img class=\"cropped\" src=\"/media/my-standing-desk/7_s.jpg\"></a>\n<a class=\"inline thumbnail\" data-lightbox=\"updesk\" href=\"/media/my-standing-desk/8.jpg\"><img class=\"cropped\" src=\"/media/my-standing-desk/8_s.jpg\"></a>\n<a class=\"inline thumbnail\" data-lightbox=\"updesk\" href=\"/media/my-standing-desk/9.jpg\"><img class=\"cropped\" src=\"/media/my-standing-desk/9_s.jpg\"></a>\n<a class=\"inline thumbnail\" data-lightbox=\"updesk\" href=\"/media/my-standing-desk/10.jpg\"><img class=\"cropped\" src=\"/media/my-standing-desk/10_s.jpg\"></a>\n<a class=\"inline thumbnail\" data-lightbox=\"updesk\" href=\"/media/my-standing-desk/11.jpg\"><img class=\"cropped\" src=\"/media/my-standing-desk/11_s.jpg\"></a>\n<a class=\"inline thumbnail\" data-lightbox=\"updesk\" href=\"/media/my-standing-desk/12.jpg\"><img class=\"cropped\" src=\"/media/my-standing-desk/12_s.jpg\"></a>\n<a class=\"inline thumbnail\" data-lightbox=\"updesk\" href=\"/media/my-standing-desk/13.jpg\"><img class=\"cropped\" src=\"/media/my-standing-desk/13_s.jpg\"></a>\n{% endraw %}</p>\n<p>It’s been a few months since I’ve had my UpDesk and I use it daily for work. I typically stand up a few hours a day and rotate back and forth. I sweat when I’m standing and standing too much flares up my hemorrhoids. I’ve got a mat to stand on which helps some.\nI feel more productive when standing, and I like to have client meetings while I stand so I can walk around some. I do use the whiteboard to hash out ideas in my head but I still find myself using pencil and paper too.</p>\n<h3>DOWNside of UPdesk</h3>\n<p><strong>The real downside to this product is the cost.</strong> However, I believe you get what you pay for though, and this is a solid build desk. Doesn’t wobble, supports my 3 monitors with no problem and gets moved up and down minimum twice a day.</p>\n<p><strong>Another downside to this desk is that it isn’t kid friendly.</strong> My twenty-month old daughter can push the up and down arrows and if I’m sitting under the desk it comes down on the chair and the desk starts to tilt and raise up. I don’t use the presets because she constantly re-programs them. It would be nice if this thing had an off/on switch at the back of the controller or something.</p>\n<p><strong>My last complaint is that the edge of the desk is too rough.</strong> Now don’t get me wrong, the desk isn’t cutting slahes into my skin so that I bleed all over the place but this is an area of improvement. As a developer my hands are on the keyboard constantly and my wrists will rest on the edge of the desk. It’d be cool if it had a more rounded corner at the edge of the desk - especially for one that costs so much.</p>\n<h3>UPside of UPdesk</h3>\n<p><strong>The desk moves up and down quickly and quietly.</strong> However we have a lot of black outs here. So I have a UPS battery that helps keep my computers running if the power flickers. When I first plugged my desk into the battery section then anytime I re-positioned the desk it made the UPS beep constantly. I ended up mounting another surge protector to the desk.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>surge protector is battery protected (for computer, router, dsl modem)</li>\n<li>other surge protector is not battery protected (for monitors, printer, things I don’t care if they shut off during power surge)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Increased productivity and organization.</strong> I keep papers and things on my desk but I find I am constantly re-organizing my desk to keep it clutter free. This is exactly what I wanted so that I don’t have papers and bills just lingering around for months. I am able to walk around and think while I code too, if I’m standing up. Google Hangout meetings are awesome with this thing.</p>\n<p>The desk has helped my carpal tunnel. I still have some carpal tunnel but not the pain shooting through my wrists kind anymore after a long days work.</p>\n<h3>Buyers Remorse? Yes or no? Closing Thoughts?</h3>\n<p>It has been almost 7 months with this desk and I don’t regret the purchase on bit. It was a bit expensive but given my line of work: it was a good investment and tax deductible too.</p>\n<p><em>I would recommend a standing desk to anyone who works from home and sits a lot.</em></p>\n<p>I will add though that if you are trying to loose weight or become more conciseness about your health then just adding a standing desk to your life isn’t going to fix all your problems. <span class=\"lg\">It certainly didn’t fix all my health problems. So keep in mind if you are buying a desk solely for your health, it isn’t going to work miracles.</span></p>\n<p>That being said, if you can <strong>afford it</strong> and the <strong>whiteboard is something you’ll use</strong> then I say <strong>do it</strong>. If the price is too expensive you might consider a different type of UpDesk, like the one without the whiteboard. Even though a standing desk isn’t going to perform some miracle on your health you still shouldn’t sit around all day, it is shaving the years off your life.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE (MAY 16th 2014)</strong></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2036834894/the-most-affordable-automatic-sit-to-stand-desk\">STANDdesk</a> looks pretty nice and is half the cost. I have a buddy who ordered one, I’ll check his out and update here accordingly.</p>\n",

But what the hell, you’re reading this right? I agree with David on many things: especially on the points like <strong>code clarity &amp; knowing the trade offs involved with TDD</strong>.</p>\n<p>I work a lot with Laravel and I see the community diving into things like the hexagonal pattern and DDD. I’m not personally working on a large application like Facebook. I write at best, medium sized applications. My experience with DDD and hexagonal is that when done on smaller projects, it turns seemingly simple and harmless code into complex and over-engineered crap. <strong>I’ll say it again, code to crap</strong>.</p>\n<h4>There is little beauty in turning simple into complex.</h4>\n<p>I’ve done hexagonal layering and repositories. The real problem I was trying to tackle was <em>code maintainability, project risk and developer sanity</em>.</p>\n<p>I’ve been writing code for over a decade. I get paid to do it too. I consider myself a professional and I don’t always test first. I also still haven’t found a silver bullet when developing though. Sometimes I prototype first. Other times I’ll write a test spec and then write code to satisfy that spec. It just depends on the situation really.</p>\n<p>However, writing a test first ensures that I am writing an end-result I can feel confident about. But I don’t want tests to drive my design. Changes dictate my design. It is one of the most important factors of my design. That is not to say that domain is any less important but I like to follow this age-old principle:</p>\n<p>{% blockquote %}\nEncapsulate the things that change. Let sleeping dragons lie.\n{% endblockquote %}</p>\n<p>Okay, that last part about dragons I just made up. If some code (the dragon) never changes, don’t write a bunch of indirection or abstractions around that code. Also a manual test would work just fine here. Anything else and it’s just making it harder man.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of doing it in style. In Taylor’s laravel/cashier project he has a class called Invoice that can print off a pdf receipt of an invoice. However, one of the methods of an invoice is called <a href=\"https://github.com/laravel/cashier/blob/master/src/Laravel/Cashier/Invoice.php#L341\">getPhantomProcess</a> which uses the external phantomjs binary file in order to create a pdf document. Is this bad design? It seems to violate open/closed and single responsibility principles. This code is less flexible because the only way to create pdf documents is through phantomjs. But notice Taylor made his code simple to follow, it’s elegant. He didn’t let tests dictate his design either.</p>\n<p>Taylor could have injected in a dependency for Invoice that allows for a pdf to be created some other way. It certainly would have been easier unit tested this way. However, this part of the code is not going to change. Taylor is always going to use Phantomjs, so he is content. And thus, my point:</p>\n<h4>Less work, still works.</h4>\n<p>Everyone knows Taylor is an awesome developer. One thing that makes him great is that he is okay with breaking rules if it makes life easier. David, Kent and Martin all seem to be the same way too. I can agree with that. Make life easier.</p>\n<h3>TDD is not dead.</h3>\n<p>I don’t agree that TDD is dead though. I think it has evolved. To know if TDD is dead, we should define it. Uncle Bob states three principles of TDD are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Write no production code, except to pass a failing test.</li>\n<li>Write only enough of a test to demonstrate a failure.</li>\n<li>Write only enough production code to pass a test.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The TDD principles are not the problem here. Notice these principles say nothing specific about your tests. It doesn’t say that you have to write tons of mocks and unit tests. TDD doesn’t say anything about your architecture or design. I like to interrupt these 3 principles slightly different, much like writing an essay article:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create an outline that satisfies my objective (perhaps my objective is to inform you about cows)</li>\n<li>Using the basic outline, fill in details with some paragraphs. (here is were I write the story)</li>\n<li>Reflect. Does the objective of the story and outline still match? <small>(did I actually inform you about cows? Are there any tangents about unicorns?)</small></li>\n</ol>\n<h4>(And we don’t try to write a novel in one go. Iterate the process.)</h4>\n<p>I think the way we test is evolving. For example, (imo) testing behavior in web apps is more far important than unit testing. Sure tests might run a bit slower but unit tests produce a far less valuable feedback loop than say an integration test. In fact, the most valuable feedback loop is a <strong>customer</strong> which assuredly won’t provide feedback in mere milliseconds.</p>\n<p>Regression testing a web app seems to work well too, as I think David &amp; Kent both touched on this point when they talked about. This is a grey area where TDD is evolving. If you are writing all your tests up front, then you shouldn’t have to write regression tests right? <em>That’s not how it works in the real world.</em> What is wrong with writing tests after the fact? Nothing. That one user, QA person or that jerk down the road is going to break something and then you’ll have to go fix it. If you have time you’ll write a test to ensure it doesn’t happen again. All this to say though, just because you do regression testing, doesn’t mean you should just throw TDD out the window. It’s not all or nothing here.</p>\n<p>For modules (or that one hefty algorithm) that have simple objectives and interfaces (unlike the UX and presentation layer stuff then TDD makes a lot more sense. You start digging in to the units and approaching this with white box testing. That doesn’t mean you have to bust out Mockery and start mocking all over the place though. I’ve found that phpspec for creating doubles works well. However, if you start trying to mock large things like Eloquent, well phpspec fubars. This is just my own style though; I should get back on point.</p>\n<p>I’ve found that using TDD used in the proper cases is bad ass and produces great quality code. Some proper cases\nbeing re-usable modules, components, packages, frameworks, etc. An terrible time to use TDD is a throw-away prototype or when the problem domain’s architecture is very small or unclear.</p>\n<p>So <strong>when it makes sense</strong>, write some tests, write some code, make sure tests pass. Rinse, wash, repeat daily. In the right context, there is nothing dead about the process of TDD. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy watching Martin, Kent and David express themselves. Ever notice that Kent squints really hard when he is thinking? ++Geek awesomeness!</p>\n<p>All this said, <span class=\"lg\">adding Uncle Bob to the conversation will make the debate better.</span></p>\n",

Let’s look at some code.</p>\n<pre><code>Route::group(['before' =&gt; 'cached.request', 'after' =&gt; 'cached.response'], function()\n{\n\tRoute::get('/', function()\n\t{\n\t\tsleep(5);\n\t\treturn Response::json(array('test' =&gt; 'some data that takes a while to return'));\n\t});\n});\n\nRoute::filter('cached.request', 'CachingFilter@before');\nRoute::filter('cached.response', 'CachingFilter@after');\n</code></pre>\n<p>This code is sleeping for 5 seconds and then we could send a big chunk of data to the client. I’m just doing this sleep to show that on the next page refresh you will see results instantly because the server is responding with a 304. What does the CachingFilter look like? Let’s take a look.</p>\n<pre><code>class CachingFilter\n{\n\t/**\n\t * Create the entity we will be searching etag for\n\t */\n\tprotected function entity($request)\n\t{\n\t\treturn $request-&gt;url() . '-' . with(new DateTime)-&gt;format('d');\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Should be run before routes are executed\n\t * Will abort if etag match is found\n\t */\n\tpublic function before($route, $request)\n\t{\n\t\t$entity = $this-&gt;entity($request);\n\n\t\t$etag = new Etag($entity, $request-&gt;getEtags());\n\n\t\tif ($etag-&gt;isValid())\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tApp::abort(304);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Should be run after a route is executed\n\t * Creates a new etag for this response content\n\t */\n\tpublic function after($route, $request, $response)\n\t{\n\t\t$entity = $this-&gt;entity($request);\n\n\t\t$etag = new Etag($entity, $request-&gt;getEtags());\n\n\t \t$response-&gt;setEtag($etag-&gt;key());\n\t}\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Finally we will want to see what this Etag class is doing. It has two methods. One fetches the key for us. The other method will tell us if the etag is still valid or not.</p>\n<pre><code>class Etag\n{\n\tpublic function __construct($entity, $etags)\n\t{\n\t\t$this-&gt;entity = $entity;\n\t\t$this-&gt;etags = $etags;\n\t}\n\t/**\n\t * Create an etag cached for given request and response.\n\t *\n\t * @return  void\n\t */\n\tpublic function key()\n\t{\n\t\treturn md5($this-&gt;entity);\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Does the browser have an Etag stored for this request?\n\t */\n\tpublic function isValid()\n\t{\n\t\t$key = $this-&gt;key();\n\n\t\t$etag = str_replace('&quot;', '', $this-&gt;etags);\n\n\t\treturn $etag &amp;&amp; $etag[0] == $key;\n\t}\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>It’s important to note here that this only targets 1 client at a time. This type of client-side caching is useful for when the same url (resource) provides different content for different users. Imagine if you went to <code>/users/me</code> and saw someone else’s page?</p>\n<p>However, in the case were you are fetching a specific set of entities then you might utilize database caching and Etags. The page <code>/pages/how-i-met-your-mother</code> is likely to be the same for all users of the system. Unfortunately this approach still requires the Laravel application to be booted so it will never be as fast as just serving a static html file.</p>\n",

This allows caches to be more efficient, and saves bandwidth, as a web server does not need to send a full response if the content has not changed. ETags can also be used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help prevent simultaneous updates of a resource from overwriting each other.\n{% endblockquote %}\n",

I ended up using the <em>–upgrade</em> flag when doing a pip install for google-api-python-client and urllib3. Next when I ran</p>\n<pre><code>gcalcli agenda\n</code></pre>\n<p>I got this <code>ERROR: Missing module - cannot import name __version__</code></p>\n<p>After searching some I found that this is an issue in the apiclient library and can be fixed by opening <code>/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/apiclient/model.py</code> and commenting out the line</p>\n<pre><code>#from apiclient import __version__\n</code></pre>\n<p>Hopefully everything goes smoothly for you after this and then you should have your browser open when you run <code>gcalcli agenda</code>. You’ll need to approve the gcalcli application for your google account. After this you should be able to see your events by running <code>gcalcli agenda</code> once again.</p>\n<p>However, we aren’t done yet.</p>\n<p>You may not always be logged into google or your oauth session may expire. So you’ll need to enable the calendar API and register an application for gcalcli at <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/console\">https://cloud.google.com/console</a> so that you can be sure to access your agenda’s later down the road.</p>\n<p>To do this plugin in the client id and secret from the app you created into the file <code>~/.gcalclirc</code></p>\n<p>Lastly, how do you get notified about your calendar events? It’s easy. Just setup a cronjob to run the remind command from gcalcli.</p>\n<pre><code>crontab -l\n# run reminders every 10 minutes which will send-inotify\n# when an event actually exists that you need to be reminded about\n*/10 * * * * /usr/local/bin/gcalcli remind\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now all that is left is to go remind yourself to do some tasks via Google or in your indicator task bar. Having your events in Google calendar though let’s you propagate out on other devices like your phone so it’s a pretty sweet setup to have Google Calendar integration with Ubuntu notifications. Good luck, and may the odds be never in your favor?</p>\n",

The bigger the alphabet the more difficult it is to brute force an answer. I wrote a brute force approach as a comparasion and just in case I can’t figure this out solution, but I ended up solving the problem the non-brute force way before execution was finished.</p>\n<p>That was just luck though because the answer starts with an ‘a’ which happens to be one of the first characters of the alphabet. If our answer had started with a ‘w’ then we would have searched about <strong>15^9 (over 38 billion)</strong> different hash combinations which would take many lifetimes to accomplish.</p>\n<p>It’s never good to have code that dramatically changes execution time depending on input, especially code that takes 100s of years to complete, so instead we are going to use math and reverse engineer the hashing algorithm so that we can find answers in constant time regardless of input.</p>\n<p>So here is our given alphabet.</p>\n<pre><code>var alphabet = &quot;acdegilmnoprstuw&quot;;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next I establish the base we are in. There are fifteen letters in this alphabet so we are using the mathematical base 15 (HEX).</p>\n<pre><code>var base = alphabet.length;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next I duplicate the hash function from the question. I use this to hash various results and to also test that hashing the string <em>leepadg</em> returns 680131659347.</p>\n<pre><code>function hash(the_string)\n{\n    var h = 7;\n\n    for (var i = 0; i &lt; the_string.length; i++)\n    {\n        h = (h * 37 + alphabet.indexOf(the_string[i]));\n    }\n\n    return h;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The mathematical formula for this hash function expanded is</p>\n<p>{% blockquote %}\n37^9 * 7 + 37^8 * s1 + 37^7 * s2 + … + 37^2 * s7 + 37^1 * s8 + 37^0 * s9 = 910897038977002\n{% endblockquote %}</p>\n<p>where s1 is the first character in our 9 digit string and s9 is the last. The value of s1 thru s9 cannot be greater than 15 or less than 0 either.</p>\n<p>Now the real magic comes in. All I am going to do is cut down the number of searches needed to find the answer <em>dramatically</em>. I still use <code>hash</code> function though, instead of searching for billions of solutions, we smartly guide our search with this algorithm below.</p>\n<p>We start with the smallest possible hash the answer could be. Since the letter a is the smallest letter in the alphabet there can be no string <strong>before</strong> the string <code>aaaaaaaaa</code>. Now if I treat this string like it is some very large number in the base of 15 of our alphabet then I start at the very highest power which is the very first ‘a’. If you don’t get this let me explain in further detail.</p>\n<p>It might be strange to see <code>aaaaaaaaa</code> as a number. But what if this was written as <code>111111111</code> instead? The highest power is the first 1 which is 1 * 10^9 = 10000000. Since we are treating letters of our alphabet as a set of numbers we can do the same thing. We are used to dealing with the set of real numbers, but in this we only need to worry about the set of characters inside of our alphabet.</p>\n<p>Let A = 910897038977002. We were given this number and it is the one we are trying to crack.</p>\n<p>So if we look at <code>A - hash('aaaaaaaaa')</code> there are three possible outcomes. The result is bigger than 0, smaller than 0 or exactly 0.</p>\n<p>So let’s talk about each one of those possibilities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the answer is 0 we are finished, and we have found our solution.</li>\n<li>If the answer here is less than 0 then there is no possible solution.</li>\n<li>If the answer here is more than 0 then we need to continue looking for solutions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our job is to traverse through every letter from beginning to end and find the highest letter possible for each power. This will give us an answer if there is a solution. In this case <code>A - hash('aaaaaaaaa') &gt; 0</code> but <code>A - hash('caaaaaaaa') &lt; 0</code> so we know the first letter must begin with an <code>a</code>. If this doesn’t make sense then allow me to explain differently.</p>\n<p>Let’s play this algorithm out but imagine we are dealing with just simple normal numbers. We have the answer 422. We want to find the number 422. So we start with the lowest number 000. Next we ask ourselves a series of questions in this order</p>\n<p>000 &lt; 422 (yes)\n100 &lt; 422 (yes)\n200 &lt; 422 (yes)\n300 &lt; 422 (yes)\n400 &lt; 422 (yes)\n500 &lt; 422 (no)</p>\n<p>Now on to the next power</p>\n<p>410 &lt; 422 (yes)\n420 &lt; 422 (yes)\n430 &lt; 422 (no)</p>\n<p>Now to the smallest power</p>\n<p>421 &lt; 422 (yes)\n422 = 422 (solution found)</p>\n<p>This gives you an idea of the alogrithm we are using but the only difference is that we make use of the <code>hash(string)</code> function each time we do our comparison. This is essentially much like prime factorization, especially since the number 37 is a prime number and we are subtracting powers of 37 away from the answer in order to find our reverse hash. So let’s look at the implementation</p>\n<pre><code>function reverse_hash(A)\n{\n    var answer = 'aaaaaaaaa';\n\n    // subtract away the max amount possible without going negative\n    // we start with 'aaaaaaaaa' and work our way up, one letter at\n    // a time (from beginning 'a').\n    for (var column = 0; column &lt; 9; column++)\n    {\n        var charAt = 0;\n        var next = answer;\n\n        // we cannot ever go more than the base of our alphabet\n        while (charAt &lt; base + 1)\n        {\n            // replace the letters at the given column\n            next = next.replaceAt(column, alphabet[charAt++]);\n\n            // we did not go negative so we can update our answer\n            if (A - hash(next) &gt;= 0)\n            {\n                answer = next;\n            }\n            else\n            {\n                break; // go to the next column in answer\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    return answer;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Finally I add a helper function to the String.prototype to replace characters. I normally wouldn’t mess with String.prototype but since I am not using this application on a large scale it doesn’t matter.</p>\n<pre><code>String.prototype.replaceAt = function(index, letter)\n{\n    return this.substr(0, index)\n        + letter\n        + this.substr(index+letter.length);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>To find the reversed hash answer in just milliseconds we can use our new <code>reverse_hash</code> command.</p>\n<pre><code>var answer = reverse_hash(910897038977002);\n</code></pre>\n<p>And that is it. Oh and if you are wondering what the answer is: <code>asparagus</code> There is probably another 20 ways to solve this problem but this is the way I chose. Did you actually make it here? Wow… I figured I would have bored most people off by this line.</p>\n",

It handles resolving the string <code>class.method</code> for us using Laravel’s IoC container.</p>\n<pre><code>function resolve($name, $args = array())\n{\n\t$parts = explode('.', $name);\n\n\t$obj = App::make($parts[0]);\n\n\treturn call_user_func_array(array($obj, $parts[1]), $args);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And there we have it. A simple way to inject variables in your Blade views. I am not using this at the moment so it’s only a proof of concept. One nice thing about this approach is that you can easily see all the registered variables inside of your view and know where they come from. But this approach doesn’t allow you the flexibility to re-use views with different variables - which is a primary reason why we use controllers - separation of concerns!</p>\n",

            "content_html": "<p>We all love moments of clarity. That moment when things just click. I’ve had a few of these in my life time and now I’d like to share one with you. What feels like a very very long time ago I watched Brian Mann’s <a href=\"http://www.backbonerails.com/series/engineering_single_page_apps\">backbone on rails</a> series. I’m a bit of a tight ass so it was a big deal for me to spend money on these videos but I’m glad I did. During the hour long easy to follow explanation of how Mann organizes his application, it was a single picture that made things click. Ah… that prized moment of clarity. I’ll share the picture with you.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<img src=\"/media/moments-of-programmer-clarity/marionette-video.png\" alt=\"A Momemnt of Clarity\">\n<p>So a picture is worth a thousand words but without some context here you probably don’t understand the big deal about this picture. You probably look at it and brush it off like some outdated UML diagram or math equation. Allow me to explain how this picture changed my thinking. Before watching the Mann videos, I had been thinking in MVC. I used Rails and Laravel models, views, and controllers. Anything else was pure chaos. Oh, how I desired to confirm to convention over configuration. I would fight tooth and nail for convention over configuration. However, the problem I kept running into though was as my applications grew, so did my models, views and controllers.</p>\n<p>During my Java programming days I had usually thrown stuff in the <code>src/</code> directory with little thought. I whimsically named classes and they often had many responsibilities. The results were typically large bloated classes that I dreaded visiting. I think that is why, partially, when I got bit by the MVC bug, I fell hard. I was in love with MVC. It was the true path to organizing my application. It just made sense and gave my programming direction. This is where the database stuff goes, this is where the routes go, this is where the html goes and I just sprinkled the business logic in controllers and wherever it needed to go. So let’s look at our image again.</p>\n<img src=\"/media/moments-of-programmer-clarity/marionette-video.png\" alt=\"A Moment of Clarity\">\n<p>In this application we have three parts Users, Leads and Appointments. Using Rails we could scaffold out some CRUD (create-read-update-delete) for the models, views, and controllers but it is rarely that simple. Notice in this example, when you show a user you need to view Users and Leads and also list Appointments for that user. This is how real world applications work. Despite our best attempts to separate models, views and controllers into CRUD actions, things will over time end up all mixed and mangled together.</p>\n<h3>Here is the lesson learned from my moment of clarity.</h3>\n<h2>When you have a complex problem get help</h2>\n<p>It’s simple when you think about it. If your controller is taking on too much water (responsibility), the controller can ask for help from other class. <strong>Delegate</strong> the hard work. In this case, Brian goes on to say we should only ask for help from our parents. What is a parent? It is the successor who reigns over your family tree. In the case of this example image: Users and Application are parents to Users.Show and Application.List methods respectively. This means that <code>Users.Show</code> must not know about <code>Appointments.List</code>.Instead Users.Show communicates with the global message broker that his parent provides to him, <code>App.request('appointment.listings')</code>. <code>Users.Show</code> has no clue who will answer the <code>appointment.listings</code> request but <strong>someone</strong> will.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile in Cyberland, the Appointment component has already told it’s parent (App) that he will handle any requests for <code>appointment.listings</code> and thus later he receives an anonymous call from User component and responds to it. This is all in the context of Marionette, but the concept applies across all programming languages: <strong>when dealing with complex issues, ask for help.</strong> Let’s illustrate our principle using a Laravel controller</p>\n<pre><code>require_once('./lib/Stripe.php');\n\nclass UserController extends Controller\n{\n\tpublic function store()\n\t{\n\t\t$rules = [\n\t\t\t'email' =&gt; 'required|email|unique:users:email',\n\t\t\t'password' =&gt; 'required|min:8|confirmed',\n\t\t\t'first_name' =&gt; 'required',\n\t\t\t'last_name' =&gt; 'required',\n\t\t];\n\n\t\t$validator = Validator::make(Input::all(), $rules);\n\n\t\tif ($validator-&gt;fails())\n\t\t{\n\t\t\treturn Redirect::back()-&gt;withErrors($validator)-&gt;withInput();\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tStripe::setApiKey(&quot;sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2&quot;);\n\n\t\tStripe_Plan::create(array(\n\t\t\t&quot;amount&quot; =&gt; 2000,\n\t\t\t&quot;interval&quot; =&gt; &quot;month&quot;,\n\t\t\t&quot;name&quot; =&gt; &quot;Amazing Gold Plan&quot;,\n\t\t\t&quot;currency&quot; =&gt; &quot;usd&quot;,\n\t\t\t&quot;id&quot; =&gt; &quot;gold&quot;)\n\t\t);\n\n\t\t$customer = Stripe_Customer::create(array(\n\t\t\t&quot;card&quot; =&gt; Input::get('stripeToken'),\n\t\t\t&quot;plan&quot; =&gt; &quot;gold&quot;,\n\t\t\t&quot;email&quot; =&gt; Input::get('email'))\n\t\t);\n\n\t\t$user = new User;\n\n\t\t$user-&gt;email = Input::get('email');\n\t\t$user-&gt;password = Input::get('password');\n\t\t$user-&gt;first_name = Input::get('first_name');\n\t\t$user-&gt;last_name = Input::get('last_name');\n\t\t$user-&gt;stripe_id = $customer-&gt;id;\n\t\t$user-&gt;save();\n\n\t\t$interests = new UserInsterest;\n\n\t\t$interests-&gt;user_id = $user-&gt;id;\n\t\t$interests-&gt;football = Input::get('football_checked', false);\n\t\t$interests-&gt;basketball = Input::get('basketball_checked', false);\n\t\t$interests-&gt;baseball = Input::get('baseball_checked', false);\n\t\t$interests-&gt;mma = Input::get('mma_checked', false);\n\t\t$interests-&gt;soccer = Input::get('soccer_checked', false);\n\t\t$interests-&gt;golf = Input::get('golf_checked', false);\n\t\t$interests-&gt;tennis = Input::get('tennis_checked', false);\n\n\t\t$interests-&gt;save();\n\n\t\t$accounts = UserSocialAccount::where('email', $user-&gt;email)-&gt;get();\n\n\t\tforeach ($accounts as $account)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t$account-&gt;user_id = $user-&gt;id;\n\t\t\t$account-&gt;save();\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t$data = [\n\t\t\t'user' =&gt; $user,\n\t\t\t'some_message' =&gt; 'You are awesome!',\n\t\t];\n\n\t\tMail::send('emails.welcome', $data, function($message)use ($user)\n\t\t{\n\t\t  $message-&gt;from('please-reply@yoursite.com', 'Some Dude');\n\t\t  $message-&gt;to($user-&gt;email, $user-&gt;first_name)-&gt;subject('Thanks for signing up!');\n\t\t});\n\n\t\tSession::flash('message', 'Welcome to the site!');\n\t\treturn Redirect::to('/');\n\t}\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>There is a ton to look at here. This controller is doing too much work on his own. The code all works as expected but it is hard to work with and troubleshoot. Thus when the boss asks you to add that extra cool feature - you know… the one where if a user picks certain interests then they should get different types of emails - where do we shove that logic? The code keeps piling up in one spot. So let’s re-factor this code. First I’m going to look for <code>return</code> statements. <strong>Next I’m going to make a statement</strong>: <em>returning a redirect, response and setting session messages is the primary responsibility of a controller</em>. The secondary responsibility is to reach out to his friend that best handles the job for this particular action (route). Thus our <code>UserController</code> transforms into this:</p>\n<pre><code>class UserController extends Controller\n{\n\tpublic function store()\n\t{\n\t\ttry\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t$user = Users::createNewUser(Input::all());\n\t\t}\n\t\tcatch(ValidationException $e)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\treturn Redirect::back()-&gt;withErrors($e-&gt;getValidator())-&gt;withInput();\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tSession::flash('message', &quot;Welcome to the site {$user-&gt;first_name}&quot;);\n\n\t\treturn Redirect::to('/');\n\t}\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>All we did was ask for help from another class called <code>Users</code>, specifically the <code>createNewUser</code> method. To handle validation we use exception handling but if you don’t like the way this looks then you could get rid of the <code>try ... catch</code> statement and replace it with an <code>if</code> statement. Because validation is something that is done so often in an application, I like to use a little Laravel magic and register an error handler for validation exceptions. I’ll register this error handler somewhere in the bootstrapping of Laravel (i.e. app/global/start.php).</p>\n<pre><code>App::error(function(ValidationException $e)\n{\n\treturn Redirect::back()-&gt;withErrors($e)-&gt;withInput();\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>And viola! Now we can remove the <code>try ... catch</code> from our controllers.</p>\n<pre><code>class UserController extends Controller\n{\n\tpublic function store()\n\t{\n\t\t$user = Users::createNewUser(Input::all());\n\n\t\tSession::flash('message', &quot;Welcome to the site {$user-&gt;first_name}&quot;);\n\n\t\treturn Redirect::to('/');\n\t}\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Of course I can always catch the exception in the controller if I need fine grained special handling but for the most part, when I get a validation errors, I typically just redirect the user back with error messages and have them fix their form input so this is a pretty sensible default for the entire <code>App</code>.</p>\n<p>To wrap things up the idea of seeking help from close friends is one of the basis of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Demeter\">Demeter’s Law</a>. I had heard of the Law of Demeter in conversations, but never really gave it much thought when developing. Sometimes really good advise only makes its way into my brain after I fail to follow said advise and a few fails later I can have an epiphany.</p>\n<p><em><strong>When you are faced with complex problem, seek help from others that you trust</strong></em></p>\n",

Php documentor warns too that there are a lot of dependencies to download so it is likely that I’m just downloading too much. I decided to go a different approach and download the 30 megabyte phar file from <a href=\"http://www.phpdoc.org/phpDocumentor.phar\">http://www.phpdoc.org/phpDocumentor.phar</a>.</p>\n<p>After downloading the phar I ran it and it gave the this error:</p>\n<pre><code>PHP Fatal error:  Class 'phpDocumentor\\Application' not found in phar:///home/K.D./.bin/phar/phpDocumentor.phar/src/phpDocumentor/Bootstrap.php on line 63\n</code></pre>\n<p>So after scouting around some, I found a link on phpDocumentors website that said, “if you have any issues consult: <a href=\"http://silex.sensiolabs.org/doc/phar.html#pitfalls\">http://silex.sensiolabs.org/doc/phar.html#pitfalls</a>”.

When you forget place a doc block over a method it produces an error in phpDocumentor, which is pretty cool.</p>\n<h2>Apigen</h2>\n<pre><code>$ php vendor/bin/apigen generate --source src/ --destination public/apigen\nApiGen 2.8.0\n------------\nScanning /src\n[===============================================================&gt;] 100.00%  14MB\nFound 207 classes, 0 constants, 0 functions and other 5 used PHP internal classes\nDocumentation for 207 classes, 0 constants, 0 functions and other 5 used PHP internal classes will be generated\nUsing template config file /vendor/apigen/apigen/templates/default/config.neon\nGenerating to directory public/apigen\n[&gt;                                                               ]   0.77%  19MB\nThe class SoftDeletingTrait is in use but has not been found in the defined sources.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Uh oh… it doesn’t know what SoftDeletingTrait is because that is Laravel specific class that is being used in one of my classes. So how to get this thing to work? I started by trying a config file. The SoftDeletingTrait class is in the vendor/ folder so maybe I could exclude that folder but apigen would be smart enough to scan that folder for missing links.</p>\n<p>php vendor/bin/apigen generate --source “src,vendor” --destination public/apigen --skip-doc-path=“vendor”</p>\n<pre><code>ApiGen 2.8.0\n------------\nScanning\n /home/K.D./workspace/lbm/package-devise/src\n /home/K.D./workspace/lbm/package-devise/vendor\n[=======&gt;                                                        ]  13.05% 116MB\nUsed 91% of the current memory limit, please increase the limit to generate the whole documentation.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Crap. Well… I’m off to edit <code>/etc/php5/cli/php.ini</code> and I up the memory limit from 128MB to 1GB. That should be enough right?</p>\n<pre><code>memory_limit = 1024M\n</code></pre>\n<p>After running for some a few minutes I still ended up getting the same error.</p>\n<pre><code>The class SoftDeletingTrait is in use but has not been found in the defined sources.\n</code></pre>\n<p>So this has all been in vain. Perhaps there is some way to tell apigen to forget about these external classes? The documentation is not very helpful but I do see an <code>--internal</code> flag. That doesn’t help though. After googling some I don’t find any helpful material save <a href=\"https://github.com/apigen/apigen/issues/158\">one github request</a> that looks related but has been ignored and closed. So I give up on this one - it has far exceeded the 5-10 rule anyway. So Apigen is out.</p>\n<h2>Sami</h2>\n<p>This is the same documentor that Taylor uses for Laravel api so it was high on my list of documentors to checkout. I started by creating a configuration file (in my project root) called <code>sami.php</code>:</p>\n<p>{% code %}\nuse Sami\\Sami;\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Finder\\Finder;</p>\n<p>$iterator = Finder::create()\n-&gt;files()\n-&gt;name(’*.php’)\n-&gt;in(<strong>DIR</strong> . ‘/src’);</p>\n<p>return new Sami($iterator, array(\n‘title’                =&gt; ‘Devise’,\n‘build_dir’            =&gt; <strong>DIR</strong>. ‘/public/docs’,\n‘cache_dir’            =&gt; <strong>DIR</strong>. ‘/.sami-cache’,\n‘default_opened_level’ =&gt; 2,\n));\n{% endcode %}</p>\n<p>Apparently you can also do themes with Sami. The quickstart docs aren’t clear on themeing but I could create a directory called <code>mytheme</code> and put a manifest.xml in it and then place <code>'template' =&gt; 'mytheme'</code> into the array containing title, build_dir, cache_dir, and default_opened_level. I didn’t need to go into themeing just yet as I’m just testing things out so I just left the theme alone (as default). To run get some documentation I then ran:</p>\n<pre><code>vendor/bin/sami.php update sami.php\n</code></pre>\n<p>This produced some really nice looking documentation. A downside to sami is that because it is all contained with an iframe, it is difficult to share links. If you right click on a frame page and open in new tab you can use that link to send to someone, <em>but</em> you loose your cool sidebar (because I’ll say it again… it is an html frame). I didn’t even know we did frames anymore. I haven’t produced one since about two decades ago.</p>\n<h2>PHP Rocco</h2>\n<p>I’ve used used docco (node) in the past but in this specific case, annotated source really didn’t provide much value. I wanted to see how easy it was to generate though so I spent the 5 minutes and got it working easily. If we needed annotated source this would be a no-brainer.</p>\n<pre><code>phrocco -i src/ -o public/annotated\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Using composer to generate your docs</h2>\n<p>We ended up using but it’s kind of a pain in the ass to remember to type all this stuff. It would be nice if we could just type: <code>make docs</code>. How about the next best thing: <code>composer docs</code>. We can create this script alias using composer:</p>\n<pre><code>&quot;scripts&quot;: {\n  &quot;docs&quot; : &quot;vendor/bin/sami.php update sami.php&quot;\n},\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we’ve got our <code>composer docs</code> and all is well. Not to toot my own horn, but this is a pretty cool setup. <strong>Toot toot.</strong></p>\n",

We can use this trait but I’d personally rather copy and paste the code into a new class. I mean, this trait isn’t doing anything special that we can’t do ourselves. Plus, having it in our class allows us to get a little more flexible with this concept Taylor has provided in his code. The concept is, we can search the composer.json for certain namespaces in our application. There is nothing keeping us from adding additional namespaces to composer.json and searching those.</p>\n<pre><code>class NamespaceDetector\n{\n\tpublic function getAppNamespace()\n\t{\n\t\treturn $this-&gt;getNamespaceForPath(app_path());\n\t}\n\n\tprotected function getNamespaceForPath()\n\t{\n\t\t$composer = json_decode(file_get_contents(base_path().'/composer.json'), true);\n\n\t\tforeach ((array) data_get($composer, 'autoload.psr-4') as $namespace =&gt; $path)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tforeach ((array) $path as $pathChoice)\n\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\tif (realpath($searchForPath) == realpath(base_path().'/'.$pathChoice)) return $namespace;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tthrow new \\RuntimeException(&quot;Unable to detect application namespace.&quot;);\n\t}\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now to fetch the application namespace we just use the namespace detector.</p>\n<pre><code>$detect = new NamespaceDetector;\n$detect-&gt;getAppNamespace();\t// 'Horsefly'\n</code></pre>\n<p>This begs the question. Why would you need to ever get the app namespace? I mean… the developer <em>set</em> that. So he/she should already know the namespace, right? If you are working in package development or multiple <em>cms</em> applications, a need might arise for it though. One of our developers at work had a need for this. Glad Taylor has got our back.

Let’s revisit this issue.</p>\n<!-- more --> \n<p>The problem with deleting a file is that we cannot do it until after our client has downloaded the entire file. Furthermore what if we want to download a file and then refresh the page? This is not possible with server side. We might use a plugin like <a href=\"http://johnculviner.com/jquery-file-download-plugin-for-ajax-like-feature-rich-file-downloads/\">$.fileDownload()</a> to help with this. But there is another way without the need for javascript.</p>\n<pre><code>class MyController\n{\n\tpublic function index()\n\t{\n\t\treturn view('my.index');\n\t}\n\n\tpublic function download()\n\t{\n\t\t$file = $this-&gt;createSomeReport();\n\n\t\treturn Response::download($file);\n\t}\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>What ends up happening on the above code is a file is generally downloaded on the page and no refresh occurs. This is because browsers are smart enough to pick up on <em>file content-type</em> HTTP headers. So how do we get our page to refresh without javascript? We have to create the file on the server, then refresh the page. Then download the file.</p>\n<pre><code>\tpublic function download()\n\t{\n\t\t$filepath = $this-&gt;saveReportTo(storage_path() . '/reports');\n\n\t\tSession::flash('file.download', $filepath);\n\n\t\treturn Redirect::back();\n\t}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then inside <code>resources/views/layouts/application.blade.php</code> we could do this.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;\n  &lt;head&gt;\n     @if (Session::has('file.download'))\n       &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;refresh&quot; content=&quot;0;url={{ route('file-download') }}&quot;&gt;\n     @endif\n  &lt;/head&gt;\n  &lt;body&gt;\n  \t@yield('content')\n  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>And the <code>my.blade.php</code> might look like follows</p>\n<pre><code>extends('layouts.application')\n\n@section('content')\n\t&lt;a href=&quot;my/download&quot;&gt;Download file now&lt;/a&gt;\n@stop\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now let’s take a look at the routes for this application.</p>\n<pre><code>Route::get('my', 'MyController@index');\n\nRoute::post('my/download', 'MyController@download');\n\nRoute::get('file-download', ['as' =&gt; 'file-download', function() {\n\treturn Response::download(Session::get('file.download'));\n}]);\n</code></pre>\n<p>Another problem is when we create a file, we may want to remove it. This is typically the case when generating custom reports for users. We don’t want to keep these reports lingering around to fillup our disk space. To do this in laravel 5 we can use <a href=\"http://laravel.com/docs/5.0/middleware#terminable-middleware\">terminable middleware</a>. It would look something like this…</p>\n<pre><code>use Closure;\nuse Illuminate\\Contracts\\Routing\\TerminableMiddleware;\n\nclass RemoveDownloadedFileMiddleware implements TerminableMiddleware {\n\n    public function handle($request, Closure $next)\n    {\n        return $next($request);\n    }\n\n    public function terminate($request, $response)\n    {\n    \t$file = Session::get('file.download', null);\n\n    \tif ($file) unlink($file);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>We should put our file-download route inside of a group to include this middleware termination.</p>\n<pre><code>Route::group(['middleware' =&gt; ['RemoveDownloadedFileMiddleware'], function() {\n\tRoute::get('file-download', ['as' =&gt; 'file-download', function() {\n\t\treturn Response::download(Session::get('file.download'));\n\t}]);\n});\n</code></pre>\n<p>That should about cover it. Now after the user downloads the file, it will disapear forever. We could do other things besides <code>unlink</code> the file in the middleware though. We might cache it. In fact, we could skip this entire process and make a cache remover that removes files older than 30 days anytime a new file is downloaded. There’s always more than one way to skin a chicken.</p>\n",

After running some really slow tests, after about 150 tests I start getting a continious stream of error exceptions.</p>\n<pre><code>kelvindorothy:~/space/laravel-tests$ phpunit\nPHPUnit 4.8.18 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.\n\n..F..FF.F..FFFFFFFFFFFFFF\n\n.FFF.....FS......F..F..FF.FF.FSF.SF.FF  63 / 244 ( 25%)\n...FFFF.FFFF.F.F..F.....SF..F.FF.F.FF..FFFFF...SFFFF.F.SF.FF.F. 126 / 244 ( 51%)\nF.F.SFFFF.SFSF...FF.FSFFEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE 189 / 244 ( 77%)\nEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE\n\nTime: 1.08 minutes, Memory: 450.00Mb\n\nThere were 94 errors:\n\n1) Programming_Session_Confirm_Stage_Update::test_route\nPDOException: SQLSTATE[08004] [1040] Too many connections\n\n\n2) Programming_Session_Course_Row::test_route\nPDOException: SQLSTATE[08004] [1040] Too many connections\n\n    ... yeah, this goes on for a while ...\n\n    ... then we start getting weird shit like this...\n\n94) Youth_Programs::test_route\nErrorException: include(/Users/K.D./space/jccfs51/vendor/symfony/symfony/src/Symfony/Component/Finder/Exception/AccessDeniedException.php): failed to open stream: Too many open files\n\n\n    ... then some failures ...\n\nFAILURES!\nTests: 244, Assertions: 139, Errors: 94, Failures: 78, Skipped: 10.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Well crap. What to do about this problem? My tests are erroring because the framework has created too many database connections. My guess is that Laravel stores it’s entire <code>$app</code> globally and there may be some places where mysql database connections are not closed. This is causing memory leakage and eventually a bunch of <em>PDOException: SQLSTATE[08004] [1040] Too many connections</em> errors.</p>\n<p>One way to get around this <em>too many connections</em> problem is to not run so many tests all at once. We can limit our runs to only a subset of tests using phpunit suites. Here is a <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/rizqidjamaluddin/61cd7f61ca36cf5c2d5a\">gist of someone who has done it this way</a>.</p>\n<p>However, I decided to tackle the problem head on. The real problem is too many database connections. Thus we will manually close the connections ourself by overwriting the default <code>TestCase::tearDown</code> method as seen next.</p>\n<pre><code>class TestCase extends Illuminate\\Foundation\\Testing\\TestCase\n{\n    /**\n     * The base URL to use while testing the application.\n     *\n     * @var string\n     */\n    protected $baseUrl = 'http://localhost';\n\n    /**\n     * Creates the application.\n     *\n     * @return \\Illuminate\\Foundation\\Application\n     */\n    public function createApplication()\n    {\n        $app = require __DIR__.'/../bootstrap/app.php';\n\n        $app-&gt;make(Illuminate\\Contracts\\Console\\Kernel::class)-&gt;bootstrap();\n\n        return $app;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Close out database connections, so they don't add up and eventually\n     * cause a bunch of PDOException: Too many connections errors for our\n     * tests, which otherwise would work normally if ran individually.\n     *\n     */\n     public function tearDown()\n     {\n        if ($this-&gt;app)\n        {\n            $connectionName = $this-&gt;app-&gt;make('config')-&gt;get('database.default');\n\n            $this-&gt;app-&gt;make('DB')-&gt;disconnect($connectionName);\n        }\n\n        parent::tearDown();\n     }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now when we run our tests, we don’t get a bunch of PDOException errors due to the <em>too many connections.</em> That is because we are closing them. Alright! Should we stop here? Well, we could. And if you’re not that familar with Laravel’s insides, then you might do well to stop here. However, I still have a few bones to pick with these tests.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>They are pretty dang slow.</li>\n<li>They use way to much memory.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After some research I found that other people had ran into this memory issue before too. There is a nice <a href=\"https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/1798\">closed github ticket</a> which hasn’t really solved anything to date (even though the ticket dates over 2 years ago). Granted, we got around our memory problem by setting <em>memory_limit</em> to -1 but I want my tests to run faster and use less memory. It seemed to me that the obvious place to first tackle is the <code>TestCase::createApplication()</code> method.</p>\n<pre><code>public function createApplication()\n{\n    ini_set('memory_limit', -1); // yeah, I accept that Laravel likes to use lots of my memory... whatever, just do it.\n\n    $app = require __DIR__.'/../bootstrap/app.php';\n\n    $app-&gt;make(Illuminate\\Contracts\\Console\\Kernel::class)-&gt;bootstrap();\n\n    return $app;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Notice that everytime a new test is ran, Laravel is re-including and bootstrapping the application. However, we discovered earlier that the PHP garbage collection is not removing stuff under the hood of Laravel. There is a ton of stuff behind the curtain of Laravel. Some of which could remain, even after the test is completed. This means, the more tests you create, the more memory is used. I could get through about 20-30 tests before my php started to exploded due to being out of memory.</p>\n<h2>So how do we really fix this?</h2>\n<p>So in case you still don’t quite understand the issue. Let’s run a bench mark test. I’ll use the <code>ini_set('memory_limit', -1);</code> hack I mentioned at the beginning of this article. It uses over <strong>450Mb</strong> of memory.</p>\n<h3>One potential fix, re-use the same laravel application as much as possible</h3>\n<pre><code>class TestCase extends Illuminate\\Foundation\\Testing\\TestCase\n{\n    /**\n     * The base URL to use while testing the application.\n     *\n     * @var string\n     */\n    protected $baseUrl = 'http://localhost';\n\n    /**\n     * [$application description]\n     * @var null\n     */\n    public static $application = null;\n\n    /**\n     * Creates the application.\n     *\n     * @return \\Illuminate\\Foundation\\Application\n     */\n    public function createApplication()\n    {\n        if (!static::$application) $this-&gt;resetStaticApplication();\n\n        return static::$application;\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Don't call parent::tearDown()\n     *\n     * @return null\n     */\n    public function tearDown()\n    {\n        // don't call parent::tearDown() or your application will be screwed up on next test\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Resets the application. Reset whenever you do something that might\n     * affect the global $application\n     *\n     * @return null\n     */\n    public function resetStaticApplication()\n    {\n        static::$application = require __DIR__.'/../bootstrap/app.php';\n\n        static::$application-&gt;make(Illuminate\\Contracts\\Console\\Kernel::class)-&gt;bootstrap();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now with my changes in place, let’s see how things run. Will we actually be able to complete without the framework blowing up and throwing error exceptions on over half our tests because it used up too many database connections?</p>\n<pre><code>kelvindorothy:~/space/laravel-tests$ phpunit\nPHPUnit 4.8.18 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.\n\n..F..FF.F..FFFFFFFFFFFFFF\n\n.FFF.....FS....F.F..F..FFFFF.FSFFSF.FF  63 / 244 ( 25%)\nF..FFFFFFFFF.F.F..F.....SF..F.FF.F.FF..FFFFF.F.SFFFFFF.SF.FFFF. 126 / 244 ( 51%)\nF.F.SFFFFFSFSF...FF.FSFFFFFF.SFFFFFFS.FFFF.FSFF..F..FSFFFFFFF.F 189 / 244 ( 77%)\nF.FFFFF.F..F.F.FS.FF.FFFFF...F.F.FFF.FFFFFF..F...FF....\n\nTime: 27.96 seconds, Memory: 267.25Mb\n\nThere were 145 failures:\n\n1) Account_Edit_Picture::test_route\nFailed asserting that 302 matches expected 200.\n\n\n\n        ... this goes on for a while...\n\n\nFAILURES!\nTests: 244, Assertions: 228, Failures: 145, Skipped: 15.\n</code></pre>\n<p>YAY! We got a lot of failures and some skipped tests, but no weird ass errors. This looks promising. We will try this for a while and see how it turns out. We’ve ran over 600+ tests using a similar method to this on our Devise CMS tests. Hopefully, this will work well.</p>\n<p>Also, take a look at the memory and time now. It is down to <strong>27.96 seconds</strong> and <strong>267.25Mb.</strong> That’s a bit better.</p>\n<h3>Some Potential Problems with our approach to Integration Testing</h3>\n<p>There is some merit to the way Taylor setup the <code>TestCase</code>. So let’s try to understand why Taylor is resetting the application every time. If we understand that, then we’ll understand the dangers of the code I just showed you above to get around the memory problems.</p>\n<p>The application is reset because Taylor wants us to test in isolation. When we create a new application, we are creating a new IoC container. There are variables stored in this IoC container. If those variables are tampered with because of our test, then it could affect every other test. If you don’t reset those everytime, we run the risk of our application container not being isolated and thus causing certain tests to mess with each other. For example, take these two tests,</p>\n<pre><code>class TestMe extends TestCase\n{\n\tpublic function test_me1()\n\t{\n\t\tURL::shouldReceive('route')-&gt;once()-&gt;andReturn('awesome');\n\n\t\tprint URL::route('something-here'); // awesome\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * @expectedException InvalidArgumentException\n\t * @return [type]\n\t */\n\tpublic function test_me2()\n\t{\n\t\tprint URL::route('something-here');\n\t}\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Above we don’t actually have a ‘something-here’ route defined. We are mocking it with Mockery on the URL facade. I personally don’t use Mockery on Laravel’s facades often because I don’t use facades that often. However, this will show you the problem.</p>\n<p>Above we are changing the URL facade to expect the <code>route</code> method. In our second <code>test_me2()</code> method we are just asserting that an exception is thrown because we don’t have a route defined for <em>something-here</em>.</p>\n<p>This test should run successfully on the <strong>old out of the box</strong> TestCase.</p>\n<pre><code>kelvindorothy:~/space/laravel-test phpunit\nPHPUnit 4.8.18 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.\n\n..awesome.\n\nTime: 627 ms, Memory: 29.50Mb\n\nOK (2 tests, 1 assertion)\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, when we change to our modified <strong>TestCase</strong> we run into a different situation.</p>\n<p>Now our results show that mockery has been applied across both testing methods `test_me1’ and ‘testme_2’. See below.</p>\n<pre><code>kelvindorothy:~/space/laravel-test$ phpunit\nPHPUnit 4.8.18 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.\n\n..awesomeFawesome\n\nTime: 425 ms, Memory: 26.75Mb\n\nThere was 1 failure:\n\n1) TestMe::test_me2\nFailed asserting that exception of type &quot;InvalidArgumentException&quot; is thrown.\n\n/Users/K.D./.composer/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/TextUI/Command.php:186\n/Users/K.D./.composer/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/TextUI/Command.php:138\n\nFAILURES!\nTests: 2, Assertions: 1, Failures: 1.\n</code></pre>\n<p>See how now we no longer get an exception in <code>test_me2</code> because the mock we applied in <code>test_me1</code> bled over. This is why testing in isolation is a good thing. How do we deal with this? Here are some simple steps.</p>\n<h3>A few takeaway tips</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Don’t bootstrap Laravel on unit tests. Only on integration tests. We use Mockery a lot on unit tests. Unit tests however only require a single class to be loaded. Not an entire framework. If you are using Mockery in unit tests, then you should even be extending <code>TestCase</code> and <code>createApplication()</code> Feel free to make different classes such as, <code>TestCase</code> and <code>UnitTestCase</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Don’t mock things on integration tests.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Don’t try to <em>unit test</em> your models. If you really want to see your models working, write some integration tests on classes which heavily use the models. If you use a <code>Repository</code> then often you can just make calls to your repository and ensure that the models are indeed working.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use a real database and database transactions to rollback. This will save a lot of time compared to seeding your database over and over.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use different phpunit testing suites for different types of tests.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n",

Something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>/**\n * @route users.edit\n */\npublic function test_users_edit()\n{\n    $this-&gt;markTestIncomplete('This test is incomplete');\n    $response = $this-&gt;call('GET', '/users/{users}/edit');\n    $this-&gt;assertEquals(200, $response-&gt;status());\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This essentially means two things.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I don’t have to keep up with all routes I have and have not tested.</li>\n<li>It also creates a boilerplate for me to get started testing.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can find the <code>missing-routes-test</code> script <a href=\"https://github.com/kdocki/missing-tested-routes\">HERE</a>.</p>\n<h3>Laravel Testing Basics: Getting Started With A Single Test</h3>\n<p>Since most applications have users, let’s create a RESTful resource to manage our users in our application. So let’s add a resourceful route to our <code>routes.php</code> file.</p>\n<pre><code>Route::resource('users', 'UsersController');\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next we need a resource controller, so let’s run the command to create it for us.</p>\n<pre><code>$ php artisan make:controller UsersController --resource\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next we want to <a href=\"https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/testing\">test a route in Laravel</a>, I can create it using <code>artisan</code></p>\n<pre><code>$ php artisan make:test UsersTest\n</code></pre>\n<p>That gets us some code generated out that looks something like this</p>\n<pre><code>class UsersTest extends TestCase\n{\n    /**\n     * A basic test example.\n     *\n     * @return void\n     */\n    public function testExample()\n    {\n        $this-&gt;assertTrue(true);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>At this point, I want to test a route. Therefore, I add a method and use Laravel’s awesome testing methods to call the /users url.</p>\n<pre><code>    /**\n     * Check out the /users index page\n     */\n    public function test_users_index()\n    {\n        $response = $this-&gt;call('GET', '/users');\n\n        $this-&gt;assertEquals(200, $response-&gt;status());\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now when we run phpunit we get that green that everyone likes.</p>\n<pre><code>kelvinvidel:~/space/blog$ phpunit\nPHPUnit 4.8.24 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.\n\n..\n\nTime: 135 ms, Memory: 13.00Mb\n\nOK (2 tests, 3 assertions)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Granted, our test is <em>really</em> simple. It only checks for a response status of 200. If we navigate to this page it is blank because our <code>UsersController::index()</code> is empty.</p>\n<h3>Testing ALL The Things (Routes)</h3>\n<p>So are we done? No. We’ve only tested 1 route so far. Laravel ships with a nice artisan command to view all our routes.</p>\n<pre><code>$ php artisan route:list\n</code></pre>\n<p>For our basic users management application this spits out the following</p>\n<img src=\"/media/missing-laravel-tested-routes/route-list.png\">\n<p>We could manually go through this list and try to test at our own pace. But this method is prone to human errors and it’d be better to programmatically scan for the routes we have not yet tested.</p>\n<p>Thus I run the following command to see which tests are missing from our users app.</p>\n<pre><code>$ missing-route-tests\n</code></pre>\n<p>This outputs the following</p>\n<pre><code>/**\n * @route users.index\n */\npublic function test_users_index()\n{\n    $this-&gt;markTestIncomplete('This test is incomplete');\n    $response = $this-&gt;call('GET', '/users');\n    $this-&gt;assertEquals(200, $response-&gt;status());\n}\n\n\n/**\n * @route users.create\n */\npublic function test_users_create()\n{\n    $this-&gt;markTestIncomplete('This test is incomplete');\n    $response = $this-&gt;call('GET', '/users/create');\n    $this-&gt;assertEquals(200, $response-&gt;status());\n}\n\n\n/**\n * @route users.store\n */\npublic function test_users_store()\n{\n    $this-&gt;markTestIncomplete('This test is incomplete');\n    $data = [];\n    $response = $this-&gt;call('POST', '/users', $data);\n    $this-&gt;assertEquals(200, $response-&gt;status());\n}\n\n\n/**\n * @route users.show\n */\npublic function test_users_show()\n{\n    $this-&gt;markTestIncomplete('This test is incomplete');\n    $response = $this-&gt;call('GET', '/users/{users}');\n    $this-&gt;assertEquals(200, $response-&gt;status());\n}\n\n\n/**\n * @route users.edit\n */\npublic function test_users_edit()\n{\n    $this-&gt;markTestIncomplete('This test is incomplete');\n    $response = $this-&gt;call('GET', '/users/{users}/edit');\n    $this-&gt;assertEquals(200, $response-&gt;status());\n}\n\n\n/**\n * @route users.update\n */\npublic function test_users_update()\n{\n    $this-&gt;markTestIncomplete('This test is incomplete');\n    $data = [];\n    $response = $this-&gt;call('PUT', '/users/{users}', $data);\n    $this-&gt;assertEquals(200, $response-&gt;status());\n}\n\n\n/**\n * @route users.destroy\n */\npublic function test_users_destroy()\n{\n    $this-&gt;markTestIncomplete('This test is incomplete');\n    $data = [];\n    $response = $this-&gt;call('DELETE', '/users/{users}', $data);\n    $this-&gt;assertEquals(200, $response-&gt;status());\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now when I run <code>phpunit</code> again, I at least have a rough idea of how many routes we have yet to test.</p>\n<h3>How it works?</h3>\n<p>Right now I’m using annotations to mark a named route as tested. I decided for this approach because it seems easy. Another approach that <em>might</em> work is to run phpunit and keep track of which routes were called during the entire process. After that was finished, we could compare our list of routes to the entire list using <code>Route::getRoutes()</code>. I opted for the annotation route just because I wanted something quick and easy.</p>\n<p>Again you can find the script <a href=\"https://github.com/kdocki/missing-tested-routes\">HERE</a>.</p>\n<p>If you find yourself using this or have some sort of improvements or even a better way for testing all the routes in your application, please leave me a comment.

<em>SURPRISE</em>, the boy I’m talking about is me. Bet you didn’t see that coming huh? I know, I know, I’m good. I chould write Michael Bay movies. <em>Javascript best practices</em> keep changing. Some have come full circle in the last 20 years. For example, what is the real difference between,</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;button onclick=&quot;doSomething()&quot;&gt;Do Something&lt;/button&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>and</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;button ng-click=&quot;doSomething()&quot;&gt;Do Something&lt;/button&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The real difference is time. <em>Your time.</em> The first example of native javascript takes a web developer <em>seconds</em>/<em>minutes</em> to understand. The angular example takes a massive undertaking and <em>days</em>/<em>weeks</em> to learn - not to mention the exorcism later when the angular 3.0 framework completely changes and your inner demons come to life. ^_^</p>\n<p>I didn’t even mention all the <em>other</em> stuff that come with these frameworks and javascript development. Take javascript testing tools for example. Karma, which used to be testacular _(ha ha, testicles),_Jasmine, moocha, chii, QUnit, unit.js, headless phantom. For managing assets we can use component, browserfiy, bower, gulp (is Grunt <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RthZgszykLs\">still alive?</a>), include billions of jQuery/node/<whatever> plugins (which are awesome). I intentionally left out all the server-side javascript frameworks in this article because it is already too damn long.</p>\n<p>{% blockquote %}\nWhen it comes to javascript, there are simply too many ways to skin the cat.\n{% endblockquote %}</p>\n<p>Sure, fundamentally Javascript has problems as a language. It allows us to write extremely complex and obscure code that does seemingly simple things. It needs polyfils and browser checks and server/client checks. One day java<strong>script</strong> will run all our toasters.</p>\n<p>However, language problems set aside, there is also this social problem with the language. <em>Developer elitism</em> comes with the rapidly changing terriority. For example, if you’re not using the latest tools in javascript, then to other developers/employers you’re just a <em>shitty javascript developer.</em> You could have been coding javascript for years, but to be awesome you’ve gotta know <strong>React</strong> or <strong>angular</strong> or <strong>insert some framework</strong>. My next blog article should be titled: <strong>You know… using jQuery won’t kill you, right?</strong></p>\n<p>Do you have a love/hate relationship with javascript?

It does this using <a href=\"https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/validation#form-request-validation\">named form requests</a></p>\n<p>Thus you might write a controller action like so:</p>\n<pre><code>public function storeBlog(BlogRequest $request)\n{\n    // request has already been validated\n}\n</code></pre>\n<!-- more -->\n<p>So what does BlogRequest look like?</p>\n<pre><code>class BlogRequest extends BasicRequest\n{\n    public function storeBlogRules()\n    {\n        return [\n            'title' =&gt; 'required',\n            'description' =&gt; 'required',\n            'owner_email' =&gt; 'required|unique:blogs,owner_email'\n        ];\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can see what BasicRequest looks like below. If you’re doing a lot of crud applications you might benefit from having your own validations built into the request.</p>\n<h3>Problems with this approach</h3>\n<p>I’ve found 2 problems with this approach.</p>\n<h4>#1 Validation rules are stored in a Request object.</h4>\n<p>What happens if you want to re-use validation rules? A lot of people would store their validation rules on the <code>Blog</code> model to solve this problem. It just depends on how much you want to re-use your rules. Honestly, rules sometimes differ slightly enough to add another 100 lines of code in your <code>Blog</code> model, it may make sense to put them somewhere else. THe problem here is that you have to create a <strong>new BlogRequest</strong> just to get the validation rules. If you are running inside of a console Command, initiating a new <strong>BlogRequest</strong> object isn’t really that sensible.</p>\n<h4>#2 Sometimes rules need parameters</h4>\n<p>For example, sometimes we need to check for existance or uniqueness of columns on a table. Let’s go back to our Blog example example, and now we want to update a blog…</p>\n<pre><code>    public function updateBlogRules( ... )\n    {\n        // HOW TO GET $blog-&gt;id IN HERE?\n\n        return [\n            'title' =&gt; 'required',\n            'content' =&gt; 'required'\n            'owner_email' =&gt; &quot;unique:blogs,owner_email,id,{$blog-&gt;id}&quot;\n        ];\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>If we inspect <code>$this</code> inside of the <strong>BlogRequest</strong> object we notice that it has the route and request information all available to us. Thus we could make use of that and parse out route parameters to get the blog id. Something like…</p>\n<pre><code>$params = $this-&gt;route()-&gt;parameters()\n</code></pre>\n<p>But honestly, at this point, I feel the BasicRequest and BlogRequest has become too <em>magical.</em> It is almost easier just to keep validation inside the controller and skip all this extra request stuff.</p>\n<pre><code>// inside BlogsController.php\npublic function storeBlog(Request $request)\n{\n    $this-&gt;validate($request, [\n        'title' =&gt; 'required',\n        ...\n    ]);\n\n    // is this really that much worse?\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Sure, there is a place for Request validation, but I think having named request validation for every request in your application is going to cause more headaches and time than it will save.</p>\n<h3>Here is the Basic Request that BlogRequest extends (if you want to see it)</h3>\n<p>I saved this for last because it’s just a giant piece of code that you will either ignore or copy and paste.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php\n\nnamespace App\\Http\\Requests;\n\nuse Illuminate\\Foundation\\Http\\FormRequest;\n\nabstract class BasicRequest extends FormRequest\n{\n    /**\n     * Determine if the user is authorized to make this request.\n     *\n     * @return bool\n     */\n    public function authorize()\n    {\n        $method = 'authorize' . $this-&gt;findMethodName();\n\n        // we use policies for authorization so \n        // we can just ignore this for the most part\n        if (!method_exists($this, $method))\n        {\n            return true;\n        }\n\n        return $this-&gt;$method($this-&gt;route()-&gt;parameters());\n    }\n\n    /**\n     * Get the validation rules that apply to the request.\n     *\n     * @return array\n     */\n    public function rules()\n    {\n        $method = lcfirst($this-&gt;findMethodName()) .

Maybe it gets a million comments on it? This page takes forever to load and the response payload is much larger. You could remedy this by doing something like</p>\n<pre><code>@foreach ($post-&gt;comments()-&gt;paginate(15) as $comment)\n    &lt;div&gt;{{ $comment-&gt;text }} by {{ $comment-&gt;user_name }}&lt;/div&gt;\n@endforeach\n</code></pre>\n<p>But this hides the other 999,985 comments. What typically happens here is that you break this into nested resources and some front end magic code. Maybe some Vue.js, React, Svelte or whatever favor j-soup you’re into. You’ll likely end up making an ajax call to dynamically fetch more comments as the user scrolls down on the page.</p>\n<pre><code>// user scrolls down\naxios.get(`/posts/${postId}/comments`, {++page})\n</code></pre>\n<p>So this kind of scaling problem is not uncommon. I’ve worked on many Laravel applications, some large, some small. It’s been my experience that hasMany relationships end up scaling horribly, needing to be filtered or broken down into paginated lists anyway.</p>\n<p>So the question I ask is, why store relationships in your model? Why not just form it in a controller?</p>\n<pre><code>// no need to define a hasMany relationship\nclass PostCommentsController extends Controller {\n    public function index(Request $request, $postId) {\n        return Comment::where('post_id', $postId)-&gt;paginate();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>This isn’t strictly a Laravel/Eloquent issue. As I work with data mappers and entities I’ve seen this same issue come knocking like an old fr-enemy. Beware ye hasMany relationships and consider alternatives like nested resource controllers. These are clean, effecient and simple to implement.</p>\n<p>Should we abandon all hasMany relationships? No. Only when they don’t scale. Take for example, where we model real-world invoices and give each invoice many line items. This should work well because we are only going to find a few dozen line items on a single invoice at worst case.</p>\n<p>What are your thoughts?</p>\n",

As you learn abstract algebra and higher forms of math, we find that our rules of algebra are based strictly on the Real numbers set. Once you get outside of this set, it can become even more complicated. It can become ambigous.</p>\n<p>Let me illistrate. Let’s be really nit picky. Notice that in the final equation the man is missing part of a hand and also wearing different shoes. Thus if you were measuring weight, the man would technically weigh a different amount without his black shoes than with red sneakers. Thus he is no longer worth the same number as he used to be. He is technically a different variable. The answer to this problem becomes some number between 21 and 31. That’s assuming the man has mass and those aren’t anti-gravity shoes he was wearing. You can start throwing in all sorts of ambigous things to mess up the numbers.</p>\n<p>You could start throwing in different mathematical operations. We only see 2 mathematical operations, the addition and multiplication operations.</p>\n<p>What if a pair of sneakers is actually,</p>\n<pre><code>a^a + a^a + a^a = 30\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now a red sneaker is now worth approximately <code>2.50618414</code>.</p>\n<p>So for all these reasons above, I’ve come to the conclusion that any answer is acceptable. What do you think?</p>\n<p><strong>** (facebOOk trollz grammer no good)</strong></p>\n",
