Say I wanted to recursively search a directory for all the files with fish in the name, over 100KB in size and had some text: ‘awesome’ inside of the file. That would be a tough one with just native php but never to fear, Fabien Potencier is here. Oh and I forgot to mention, I only want files that have been modified since yesterday. Oh and can you sort those by name for me? Thanks.

<p>Since Laravel piggybacks off so many Symfony components, we can already use this Finder class in any Laravel application like so:</p>
<pre><code>$finder = new Symfony\Component\Finder\Finder();

$finder-&gt;files()
    -&gt;in($dir)
    -&gt;size('&lt; 100K')
    -&gt;name(&quot;{$search}&quot;)
    -&gt;date('since yesterday')
    -&gt;contains('awesome');

foreach ($finder as $file)
{
	print $file-&gt;getRealpath();
}
</code></pre>
<p>Bye, bye <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/class.recursivedirectoryiterator.php">RecursiveDirectoryIterator</a>, may we never meet again! If I ever meet Fabien I’m likely to get a restraining order slapped on me after I give him a big hug and kiss.</p>
