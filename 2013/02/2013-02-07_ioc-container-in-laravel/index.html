It allows for dependency injection and extremely testable code.

<p>I also snuck in some extra functionality. The ability to pass in parameters to the resolve. This allows us to override the resolve if we need to do so which is a nice feature when using a lot of nested DI (especially if you’re componsating for testing doubles). See below</p>
<pre><code>class Foo
{
      public $bar;
      public __construct(Bar bar)
      {
         $this-&gt;bar = bar;
      }
}

class Bar
{
   public $neato = &quot;hmm&quot;;
}

$bar1 = IoC::resolve('Bar');
$bar1-&gt;neato = &quot;Something else&quot;;
$foo1 = IoC::resolve('Foo', [$bar1]);
$foo2 = IoC::resolve('Foo');

// you can control your bars man!
print $foo1-&gt;bar-&gt;neato . ' ' .
      $foo2-&gt;bar-&gt;neato;
</code></pre>
