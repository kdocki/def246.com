                        <p>So a few months ago, I remember having lunch with Taylor at Genghis Grill and he was talking about maybe doing a video series to make money. Travis and I both suggested he write a book on Laravel. Heck, I even promised that I’d buy, so here we are a few months later and he has <a href="https://leanpub.com/laravel">his book out</a>. I’ve purchased the book, but haven’t gotten to read it yet.</p>
<!-- more --> 
<p>The book price is $30 minimum. I’ve heard some people say that his book is too expensive. They say, <em>“It’s only 64 pages long! That’s 50 cents a page!”</em> Granted, there is truth to that, but then I look on leanpub and I see a book called Codebright for the same price. Codebright repeats a lot of what could be learned for free at <a href="http://laravel.com/docs">http://laravel.com/docs</a>. Don’t mis-understand me though, I’m not out to attack Dayle Rees, as he is a prominent and helpful member of the Laravel community. I’m just pointing out that Taylor’s book price is the same as Dayle’s - which then in my opinion doesn’t make the book seem so pricey.</p>
<p>** UPDATE (11/24/2013): ** Read the book. It was short and sweet.</p>
