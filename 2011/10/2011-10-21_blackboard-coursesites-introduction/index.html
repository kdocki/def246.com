CourseSites offers anyone who signs up as an instructor 5 free courses, templates, plenty of integration such as Blackboard IM and Facebook, which means you can chat with your students that are in your course. Anyone who has a Facebook, Google, twitter, Hotmail, yahoo, i.e. OpenID account can login to CourseSites as a student - without ever creating a Blackboard account. This seems like an awesome step forward for online education. Unfortunately, it may take a few years for universities to realize that net ids and expensive custom SSO portal integration offers little value for the cost.

<p>In minutes I had configured a profile: <a href="https://ktdockins.coursesites.com/">https://ktdockins.coursesites.com/</a></p>
<p>There is a lot of potential here, even for those who are not instructors at universities. For example, someone who just wanted to offer an online course could use this - imagine this site <a href="http://www.aslpro.com">http://www.aslpro.com</a> was merged into CourseSites, forging an online class with a large repository of ASL videos. A lot of websites exist which aim at educating people, why pay for website hosting, website design, website up keep especially for those that don’t know css, html, jquery, php, etc?</p>
<img class="w-full" src="/media/blackboard-coursesites-introduction/collaborate.jpg">
<p>Don’t forgot Blackboard collaborate. A powerful tool which is essentially a live virtual classroom. I prefer Collaborate over Webex, Livemeeting, Dimdim and Adobe Connect; while Collaborate isn’t flawless, it is very slick and being heavily developed on at this time.</p>
<p>CourseSites is also used for collaborating with other Blackboard users; currently I am a member of the ASR user group and several cohorts. These aren’t really used to teach a structured course but rather to learn through a community-like process. I may setup a course (if I can think of a good idea) to illustrate some Blackboard tools and advantages to distance learning.</p>
